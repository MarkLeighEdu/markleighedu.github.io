### USD INDEX

The USD was sold off at every turn today with the index erasing yesterday's gains and going onto set a new yearly low support at 100.45. These levels were last seen in September 2024. The extreme sell-off was evident in all the major FX pairs which saw the Euro, Pound, Yen, Canadian, Aussie and Swiss franc all rally against the USD. Sentiment, bias and trend all reflected the sharp move lower. Buyers may see the technical RSI reading at 29 as an incentive for a bounce.

### S&P 500

Sellers won out the day and erased a large portion of yesterday's late day rally. The support at 5143 was well off the weekly lows of 4842. Sellers will aim to break below todays close of 5300, while buyers will aim at 5534 resistance. Notwithstanding the traditional inverse relationship between equities and the USD, current economic conditions are anything but traditional, and both the major indices are moving in tandem - both are bearish and firmly tilted downward.

### GOLD

Here the inverse relationship between the USD and gold played out in textbook fashion with the metal adding to yesterdays $100+ rally and adding another $90+ move higher on the way to setting a record high resistance at $3177. In addition to the inverse relationship, the metals safe have status as an alternative to the world's global currency translated into "panic" demand with buyers in full control as sellers remained on the sidelines. RSI at 67 may leave room until overbought levels are reached. However, profit taking is a consideration and a pause or retracement can be expected, at least on the shorter time frames.

### BRENT OIL

Yesterday's late rally was short lived as sellers took control from the open and continued the month-long sell-off establishing support at $61.92. The trade wars, tariffs unfinished business, recession fears amid a global economic slowdown all contributed to the lack of demand for oil. Sellers will look down below $60 while buyers wait for supply concerns to enter the picture. Today's resistance at $66.06 is the first upside target.

### BITCOIN

Yesterdays strong bounce appeared to give buyers the impetus to reverse the year long downward bias - from a technical perspective at least. However, buyers did not add to the gains and once again sellers stepped in and controlled the days activity. While buyers will aim to retake the $83.7 resistance, sellers may well see the level as a lower high on the daily chart. Note the fibonacci retracement indicator measuring the preceding downtrend - the current bounce got held up at the 23.8% fib retracement level at $82.5K - yesterday's close and today's resistance level. Buyers have struggled to maintain above $80K and the level is shaping up to be pivotal as price action appears comfortable in the mid $70K area.
