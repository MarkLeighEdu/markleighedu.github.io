### USD INDEX

Buyers won out over the week, maintaining the uptrend which continues to trade within a loosely formed sideways range between 97.00 and 98.00. The fightback from the USD which started last week has confirmed the resilience of the world's global currency. Support sits at 96.79 with resistance established at 98.20. Demand for the dollar has been supported by the change in rhetoric surrounding future rate decisions - 2 more cuts this year now seems less than certain.

### S&P 500

The doji-like candlestick confirms uncertainty as the index reached record highs before a strong sell-off, and then going on to bounce up late in the week, resulting in the week's price ending pretty much where it started. Support at 6625 with resistance at 6757. Buyers will be listening to talk of the index reaching 7000, while sellers may get nervous and profit taking enters the equation and picked up steam.

### GOLD

While doubt regarding the sentiment of the USD remains, and the major US equity markets get nervous at record high levels and a possible bubble, gold's safe haven status has been unquestioned. Price activity has resulted in 6 straight weeks of higher highs and higher lows with new record highs being set on a regular basis. Support at $3684 with resistance higher at $3790. To date even the inverse relationship between the USD and gold has not had an effect on the one-way rally. With no previous levels to protect the upside, the moves have been sharp with little in the way of technical indicators providing resistance levels to signal potential retracements.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers controlled price activity and did enough to establish an uptrend on the daily chart. However, the activity remains within a wider sideways range which has been in effect since late June (June 30 2025). Support at $65.35 with resistance at $69.84. Noteworthy - the break and close above $68; buyers continue to protect the $65 support area.

### BITCOIN

Buyers ended the week strong, however sellers won out over the week and the downtrend remains intact. Resistance at $115.4K with support lower at $108.6K. While the weekly price activity once again showed buyers unable to break and maintain the $117K level, the charts shows first the $112K support broken, followed by a break below $110K. Note the potential descending triangle formation (bearish sign).
