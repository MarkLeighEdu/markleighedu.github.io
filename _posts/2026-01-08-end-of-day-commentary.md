### USD INDEX

The USD strengthened today, as it has done for 10 of past 11 days with buyers confirming demand for the USD in the new year. Next target on the upside is 99.00 on the way to reaching the big 100.00 mark. Tomorrow's jobs report (NFP and Unemployment data) could go a long way to determining the next phase of the USD's direction. Resistance at 98.72 with support at 98.43

### S&P 500

Sellers put in an early run before Wall St opened (futures market), however the sell-off was short lived as buyers recouped losses through the day and went on to close back at the open level. The doji-like candlestick confirms the lack of direction. While buyers continue to look up at the 7000 mark, sellers will aim to retest 6900 on the downside in an attempt to reverse the uptrend. Resistance at 6971 with support at 6935.

### GOLD

Following an early sell-off from the Asian and European sessions, buyers stepped in at the US Open and went on to recoup losses and put in a higher close for the day. Notwithstanding the green candlestick, the activity does reflect a lower high and lower low on the chart. While trend, bias and sentiment point upward, a new bout of profit taking cannot be counted out as long as the USD continues to strengthen and $4500 resistance holds. Resistance at $4474 with support at $4405.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers first protected the $60 support, and then went on to gain $2.70 as oil rallied through the day. The previous high at $62.72 (December 10 2025) was broken, as well as the descending trendline which had been in place since July 2025. Next upside target sits at $64 (December 5 2025). Resistance at $63.00 with support at $59.95.

### BITCOIN

A day of 2 halves. Sellers started early taking out the previous 5 day's lows, before buyers stepped in at the US session and went on to recoup losses and close at the day's open price. What we've learned this week is that buyers are not able to break $95K while sellers were once again held up at the $90K support. Resistance at $91.6K with support at $89.2K.
