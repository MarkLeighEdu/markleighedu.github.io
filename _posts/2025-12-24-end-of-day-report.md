<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Buyers had the last say on Christmas eve with a gentle push higher. However, the daily candlestick reflects a lower high and lower low on the charts, adding to the downtrend. Resistance at 97.67 with support at 97.41. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> The santa rally confirmed on Christmas eve with the index setting a record high and closing on a high note. Buyers may well attempt the 7000 number by the year end. Resistance at 6990 with support at 6952.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Although sellers won out for the day, yet another new record high was set early in the Asian session with the $4500 broken to the upside. Notwithstanding the red daily candlestick, today's activity reflects a higher high and higher low on the chart, adding to the uptrend. Resistance at $4526 with support at $4441.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Buyers and sellers briefly tried higher and lower, before ending the day alongside yesterday's close. Today's doji-like candlestick confirming the indecision within the uptrend. Resistance at $62.23 with support at $61.57. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Trading activity was limited within a narrow $1.5K range. After an early test lower, buyers recouped losses and ended the day alongside yesterday's close. A lower high and lower low added to the downward bias. Resistance at $87.7K with support at $86.2K.
