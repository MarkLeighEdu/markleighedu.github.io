### USD INDEX

High 2025: 110.00; Low 2025: 95.77. Going into the new year after an up week where buyers were able to recoup the previous week's losses. However, the trend remains down with price action continuing to hover near to the 98.00 area. Note the yearly highs and lows and see the index remains well within the bottom of the range after a weak performance for the world's safe haven currency. While the USD maintains its dominance, the shift in sentiment is reflected in the numbers. Resistance at 98.22 with support at 97.58.

### S&P 500

High 2025: 6985; Low 2025: 4837. Sellers ended the year with a move down through the last week of the trading year as profit-taking and year end settling kept buyers at bay. The index had another strong year with a 16% increase confirming the demand for US equities. Note the current price sits at the top of the yearly range with buyers looking up to the 7000 level. The tariff threat did not affect the outcome of the overall stock market rally. The inverse relationship between a weak USD and strong equities played out. Resistance at 6985 with support at 4837.

### GOLD

High 2025: $4531; Low 2025: $2612. The historic year long rally did not carry through to the end as sellers stepped in and allowed for an expected bout of profit-taking to close out the year. Technicals have not really played a part in the metal's performance, whereas strong fundamentals have maintained demand for the safe haven commodity. The $4000 level appears to be the pivotal area for buyers (to protect) and sellers (to break). In addition to the Ukraine/Russia and Middle East conflicts, the US's attack on Venezuela adds to the geopolitical influences surrounding the gold price. Resistance at $4531 with support at $4269.

### BRENT OIL

High 2025: $81.66; Low 2025: $58.38. A tight range with neither buyers or sellers making a move as price activity remains within the $60.00 to $$62.00 range. Note the doji-like candlestick formation confirming the indecision and lack of direction, as the descending trendline continues to hold. The new Venezuelan crises could impact prices going into the first week of the new year. Resistance at $61.92 with support at $58.38

### BITCOIN

High 2025: $126.4K; Low 2025: $74.4K. A strong week for buyers putting in the highest weekly close since November 10th 2025. Notwithstanding the green candlestick, price activity remains contained within a narrow trading range between $86K and $91K, reflecting the cryptocurrency's inability to recover from the October/November 2025 sell-off (-$45K). Buyers will aim above $91K going into the first trading week of the new year. Resistance at $91.6K with support at $86.7K
