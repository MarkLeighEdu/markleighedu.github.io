### GOLD

Buyers took control from the outset and went on to erase last week's mild losses and in so doing initiated a new uptrend to start the week. Price action closed above $4100. Next target on the upside is the descending trendline on the way to revisiting the $4200 level. Note the traditional inverse relationship between weak USD and strong gold. Resistance at $4139 with support at $4036.

### BRENT OIL

Resistance at $62.96 with support at $61.35.

### BITCOIN

Buyers withstood an early test of support, and then went on to put in a strong rally through the US session. Higher highs and higher lows on the chart, with the EMAs gently crossing to the upside. Today's activity produced the first "2 consecutive green candlesticks" since the sharp sell-off from November 11 2025. A break above $90K could pave the way for further gains with plenty of room on the upside. Resistance at $88.9K with support at $85.1K.
