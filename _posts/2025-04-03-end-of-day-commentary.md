### USD INDEX

Following the new tariffs announced yesterday, the USD has been hit hard as the USDX, along with the major currency pairs all hit extreme levels as the USD was sold across the board. The index established support at the 101 level. This level was tested twice in 2024 and interestingly note the same 104.33 resistance as a starting point. Buyers will aim to maintain above today's close at 101.84 with 102 the first upside target. The news is still fresh and far from settled as the countries digest the numbers and consider their response. Sentiment, technical and fundamentals are all stacked against the USD. The lone "positive" could be an inverse relationship with a crashing stock market.

### S&P 500

The US stock markets sold off sharply following the tariff news announced yesterday. After gapping down before todays open, sellers were relentless as buyers stood on the sidelines as the S&P set support at 5433. The last time this level was visited was September 2024. While uncertainty persists, there doesn't appear to be a reversal or halt in the current selloff conditions. Should panic selling pick up steam sellers will look below 5400 with 5200 coming into view. Noteworthy that USDX and equities are moving in tandem in response to the fundamental news.

### GOLD

The initial shock selloff in response to the tariff news saw the metal reverse sharply from a new record high at $3160 to $3055 - a $100 drop. Yet it wasn't long for buyers to recognize an opportunity and stepped in to recoup a large portion of the loss to close the day at $3113. The commodities safe haven status looks like the last man standing as the other major instruments have not yet signalled a pause, let alone reversal in the all-encompassing selloff -namely, USDX, S&P 500 and Oil.

### BRENT OIL

Brent's March rally ($68.27 to $75.47) came to an abrupt end together with the Whie House tariff announcement yesterday. A global slowdown, recession talk, supply concerns?all contributing to the reversal. Support was established at $69.47 and lingers at the all important pivotal $70 level. While buyers will aim above $70 at a minimum, sellers will aim below $68, relatively uncharted territory.

### BITCOIN

The cryptocurrencies timid response to the tariff news is noteworthy. Price action was limited and ranged within a narrow $81K and $84K. Sellers did not jump on board the panic sell mode which we saw in the other major instruments, but more interesting is the lack of demand and apparent unwillingness of buyers to see bitcoin as a safe-haven amidst the turmoil. The current range within the low $80K area favours the downtrend. Note the descending trendline. Buyers will aim to test and break above $85K.
