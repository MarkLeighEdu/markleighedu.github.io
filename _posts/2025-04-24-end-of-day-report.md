<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The 2 day reprieve was short lived as sellers again took control from the start and sold off the U$ to confirm the negative sentiment surrounding the worlds reserve currency. Resistance remains at yesterdays close - 99.66 with support established at 98.98. Its noticeable that notwithstanding the turnaround, yesterdays low remains in place so that the charts reflect a 4th consecutive day of higher lows. Sellers will be aiming below 99 while buyers will look up to break above the almost double top formation. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Following a brief test lower and setting support at 5350, buyers put in a strong run up to the close establishing resistance at 5517. Todays move was in direct contrast to the USD sell-off, a welcome return to the traditional inverse relationship between the 2 major indices. Buyers will look up to 5738 while sellers will aim below 5400 on the downside.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> After a gap up to start the day, buyers maintained control and gently pushed higher to close at $3348. Buyers will be looking up to test resistance at $3365, while sellers will target below the $3305 support level. Todays move was enough to resume the uptrend and possibly attract buyers at the relatively attractive lower price. The fundamentals still clearly favour the commodity's safe haven status in the current uncertain market conditions.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> A narrow trading range followed yesterdays sell-off with buyers winning out and halting the slide. Resistance at $65.61 and support at $64.91 confirms the sideways trend with buyers and sellers unable to add to respective gains or losses for 2 consecutive days. Taking a step back we see the $67.66 resistance and $63.03 support containing price action with neither side able to gain control. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Although sellers did prevail - confirmed with a daily red candlestick, practically the charts tell a different story. The trend is up, bias is up and buyers ended the day with the upper hand. Support sits at $91.5K with resistance established at $93.9 - alongside yesterdays closing price. While buyers aim above $95K sellers will aim to break below the $90K mark. Sentiment feels positive for the cryptocurrency with the $100K level looking closer than it did just a week ago.
