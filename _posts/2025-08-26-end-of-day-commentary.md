### USD INDEX

The 6th consecutive day of alternating green and red daily candlesticks. Today sellers won the battle, yet the trend (EMAs) is up with the 3rd consecutive higher low on the charts. Although buyers did step in late, the bias feels weighed to the downside. While recent data has been mixed, negative sentiment continues to surround the USD. Support at 97.99 with resistance higher at 98.45.

### S&P 500

Order was restored with demand for US equities across the US stock markets. Todays move higher is in accordance with the natural inverse relationship between weak USD and strong equities. Support at 6431 with resistance set at 6482. Buyers have tested current resistance levels since the record highs set early in the month, August 13th.

### GOLD

All lined up today for the safe-haven commodity to take another big step forward and add to the well-established uptrend. Technicals favoured a push to the upside with the traditional inverse relationship between weak USD and strong gold playing out. Uncertainty regarding future rate cuts, uncertainty regarding geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, plus political uncertainty in a turbulent White House all contributed to the $36 rally. Support at $3350 with resistance at $3392.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers controlled price activity from the start and went onto erase all of yesterday's gains with a strong push lower. Resistance at $68.11 with support established at $66.59. Notwithstanding the lower high and lower low on the chart the uptrend remains in place. Sellers will aim below $66 while buyers will look above $67 as a first step to reverse today's move and get the uptrend back on track.

### BITCOIN

Buyers stepped in today and did halt the strong downtrend with a gentle bounce up off support. However, note the green daily candlestick reflects a lower high and lower low, confirming the pause, or retracement, rather than a significant reversal. The move higher measures a $1.1K push to the upside. Resistance set at $111.3K with support established at $108.6K.
