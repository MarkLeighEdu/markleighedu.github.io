### USD INDEX

The USD held its own as the index ended the week where it started. Not surprising that the U$ took a breather from the strong selloff leading into the week. The trend remains down, the bias is down and sentiment remains negative with little demand for the worlds reserve currency. The doji like candlestick confirms the uncertainty. Buyers did halt the slide bouncing up off the 102.83 support over the last 3 days of the week attempting a reversal on the daily charts. Daily resistance sits at 103.75.

### S&P 500

The major US stock markets have all been sold off amid a nervous and uncertain response to Trumps tariffs and potential trade wars. With daily threats and changes from the White House, reciprocal threats from Europe, China and Canada?it appears that panic has set in. With talk of recession and market corrections coupled with relevant support levels broken from a technical analysis standpoint, buyers are standing on the sidelines. Friday did see a bounce up off the 5559 support level as buyers established resistance at 5700 on the way to looking for a reversal on the daily charts.

### GOLD

11 green candles in the last 12 weeks. A new record high at $3005. Demand for the metal continues at every level in the face of geopolitical uncertainty, a weak USD and a crashing stock market - golds safe haven status is confirmed. While buyers are firmly in control, traders will watch for profit taking and a natural technical retracement with an RSI reading of 73 signalling overbought conditions. Pullbacks will be tested at $2960, the previous high mark.

### BRENT OIL

Following 8 weeks of red candles and a strong downtrend, buyers did win out this week as oil traded within a well- established range between $68.62 and $71.30 with neither buyers or sellers willing to make a meaningful break in either direction. The green candle suggests the bias could be slightly up, as the EMAs on the daily charts have crossed to the upside. Noteworthy that the range is clearly a leg lower than we have seen in recent years.

### BITCOIN

Notwithstanding the green candlestick, the trend remains down with a series of lower highs and lower lows. Price action was contained between $76.2K on the downside and $84.4K on the upside. The bias appears down as buyers struggle to maintain above $80K and psychologically the $100K mark looks a long way off. The hesitation from a sellers perspective is that positive rhetoric from the White House could change the picture in an instant. Buyers will aim to test and break above the $85K mark while sellers look below $80K.
