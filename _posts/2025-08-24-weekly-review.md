### USD INDEX

Buyers were in control for most the week, until Friday when sellers reversed the week's gains and put in a lower weekly close confirming the turnaround. Resistance sits at 98.73 with support established at 97.40. Price activity has been contained within the 97.50 - 98.50 range for the past 7 weeks as the EMAs continue to move sideways. The 3rd consecutive red candlestick adds to the downward bias.

### S&P 500

In typical traditional fashion the inverse relationship between USD and equities is mirrored on the charts. Sellers were in control for most the week until buyers reversed the week's losses on Friday. The sharp reversal was held up at the previous week's resistance. Support was set at 6363 with resistance up at the 6500 mark.

### GOLD

Buyers won out over the week, recouping most of the previous week's losses. The downtrend remains in place, although the EMAs continue to trend sideways as price activity remains in the familiar $3320 - $3400 range. The metal's resilience was noticeable early in the week as the USD was showing strength while gold continued to hold its own. Support at $3311 with resistance set at $3378. While buyers look above $3400, sellers aim below the pivotal $3300 - $3320 area.

### BRENT OIL

While the trend has not technically reversed as yet, buyers had a strong week with a series of higher highs and higher lows on the daily charts. The weekly green candlestick engulfs the previous red, doji-like candlestick as the bias appears tilted to the upside. Support at $64.72 with resistance set at $67.46.

### BITCOIN

Last week's record high could not be maintained as sellers stepped in and did enough to signal a downtrend as the EMAs crossed to the downside. Resistance at $117.4K with support established at $110.5K. Note the support area has been tested as a resistance area in both May and June, adding relevance to the level. The current $112K price has proved to be a strong floor protected by buyers over the past week.
