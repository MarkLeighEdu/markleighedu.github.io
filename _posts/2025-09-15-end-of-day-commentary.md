### USD INDEX

The downtrend continued and picked up steam as sellers maintained pressure throughout the trading day. Once again the now familiar support area looks to be tested. Resistance at 97.30 with support established at 96.86. Factors contributing to the sell-off: strong equities and upcoming rate cuts apparently creating little demand for the dollar.

### S&P 500

. Poor economic data appears to have little effect on the demand for US equities. S&P going on to establish yet another record high today. Buyers remaining on the sidelines regardless of overbought technicals. Sellers appear to be waiting for a retracement before considering take profit strategies. Support at 6640 with resistance at 6680. Analyst predictions talking about a 7000 level adding to the rally.

### GOLD

As the USD was sold -off, so the inverse relationship between weak USD and strong gold played out in classic style. Buyers tested and broke through resistance going on to set a new all-time high. Support at $3625 with resistance set at $3685. Unsettled geopolitical conflicts coupled with textbook technical confirmation all contributed to the perfect storm. Buyers facing no resistance/pivot levels continue to revel in unchartered territory.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers won out on the day, continuing to trade within a loosely established sideways range between $66 - $68. Support at $66.85 with resistance at $67.79. Note the push higher remains contained within the descending trendline formed with a series of lower highs on the chart.

### BITCOIN

Buyers tested higher, sellers tested lower, only for a close matching yesterday's price. A doji-like candlestick confirming the lack of direction. While the EMAs signal the uptrend remaining in place, practically price action remains sideways hovering close to the $115K area. Support at $114.4K with resistance at $116.9K. Buyers aim above $117K in order to re-ignite the uptrend while sellers look down at the $112K level on the way to reversing the trend.
