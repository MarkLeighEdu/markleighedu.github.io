<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Sellers continue to dominate price activity extending the downtrend for a 3rd consecutive day. Note the support area has been tested several times, and for the most part, continues to be defended by buyers. Resistance at 98.13 with support established at 97.64. The bias tilts downwards with negative sentiment continuing to surround the global currency.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> There is no letting up as demand for US equities continues. The index recorded a record high and record close as sellers continue to stand on the sidelines. Note the inverse relationship between weak USD and strong equities. Support at 6470 with resistance at 6522. From a technical point of view the rally has followed textbook guidelines. A bullish engulfing candlestick (August 22nd), EMAs crossed to the upside and higher lows and higher highs on the charts. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Not only did the push higher continue, buyers picked up steam and the charts continue to add higher highs and higher lows to a well-established uptrend. Buyers have struggled to maintain demand at current levels since the record high (April 22) earlier this year. Aided by a weak USD and uncertainty on several fronts - global economy and geopolitical conflicts - the safe-haven commodity may well be looking up at the $3500 mark. Support sits at $3384 with resistance at $3422.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> The uptrend continues within a loosely formed sideways range between $67 and $68. The bias is tilted to the upside. Support at $66.77 with resistance higher at $68.08. The sideways activity reflects the opposing influences for both buyers and sellers. A global economic slowdown vs supply concerns within a nervous geopolitical framework. Note an upside break leaves little in the way of resistance levels up to the $70 - $72 area. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Buyers won out today erasing yesterday's losses. The cryptocurrency appears to be surrounded by conflicting signals both technically and fundamentally. Today's candlestick reflects a 3rd consecutive higher low and higher high on the charts. Notwithstanding, the downtrend remains intact. While the White House does continually talk up digital currencies and easing of regulations, is the Trump family support necessarily boosting the value of cryptocurrencies? Support at $110.8K with resistance at $113.3K. The $112K area continues to be shaping up as a pivotal level.
