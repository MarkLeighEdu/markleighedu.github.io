<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> A 2nd consecutive day of demand across the board for the USD. Buyers matched the monthly high (September 2) with sellers standing on the sidelines. Resistance established at 98.26 with support lower at 97.39. While the uptrend gained momentum, the RSI reading at 57(daily timeframe) leaves further room on the upside before overbought technicals are signalled.   

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> A 3rd consecutive day of lower highs and lower lows on the index as sellers dominated on all the major US stock markets. Buyers did step in aggressively (same as Sept 17 2025) to recoup almost one half of the daily losses. Resistance at 6705 with support set at 6624. Note the distinct inverse relationship between strong USD and weak equities playing out.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> A gap up to start the day, with buyers holding on just slightly to record a small gain of $7 on the day - Op: $3742, Cl: $3749. Noteworthy that golds resilience stood up to a day of strong gains by the USD, without weakening as is the traditional inverse relationship between the 2 instruments. Support at $3721 with resistance at $3761. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Another strong day for oil as buyers added to the uptrend with a 3rd consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows on the chart. Current resistance levels were tested at the start of the month (September 2 2025), however sellers stepped in and reversed the preceding uptrend. Buyers will again test these levels and will be looking up at the $70 level. Support at $67.68 with resistance at $68.83.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> The build-up started September 19 as the new downtrend was triggered. Today was the breakout day as sellers took control with a $5K move breaking below significant support levels. Resistance sits at $113.6K with support established at $108.6K. Daily RSI reads at 38. While still a long way off, sellers will be eyeing the 100K mark, while buyers look up to regain $112K on the upside.
