### USD INDEX

The USD started the week on the front foot and continued throughout the day. Buyers maintained control and went on to establish resistance at 97.31. Support sits below at 96.53. Notwithstanding today's rally, USD sentiment remains negative. Note the fib retracement tool measuring the downtrend from the 99.00 high down to the 66.00 low - the reversal higher got held up at the first test (38.2%) which matches today's close at 97.14.

### S&P 500

Sellers pushed lower for the 2nd consecutive day with a lower high and lower low reversing the trend. Resistance at 6315 with support below at 62.56. Classic inverse relationship between strong USD and weak equity markets. New tariff/trade deal announcements added to the sell-off.

### GOLD

A day of two halves saw the metal sold off during the Asian and European sessions, followed by buyers stepping in at the start of the US session to close the day higher. Support set at $3296 and resistance established at $3340. Again the $3300 level proved to be a strong support and springboard for buyers to step in and recoup the day's losses. Although the daily candlestick is green, the trend remains sideways with EMAs flat.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers were in control from the start and did enough to confirm an uptrend on the charts. Resistance sits at 69.91 with support below at 67.32. While buyers aim to test and break above the $70 mark, sellers will look below $68 to reverse the trend.

### BITCOIN

Sellers dominated price activity doing enough to initiate a downtrend and insure the bias points downward. Resistance at $109.7K with support at $107.5K. Buyers have struggled to break above $110K. Sellers will aim below $107K in an attempt to add to the downtrend.
