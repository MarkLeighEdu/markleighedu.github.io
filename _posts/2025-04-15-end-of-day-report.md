<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Following yesterday's pause from the previous week's strong sell-off, buyers made slow but steady gains and in so doing ended the day with a higher high and a 3rd consecutive higher low on the daily chart. Support sits at 99.18 while buyers set resistance at 100.03. While USD sentiment remains negative, sellers have failed to add to last week's drastic run down with a semblance of stability returning to the index. Buyers will aim to maintain above the 100 mark as a first goal.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> A rather quiet, and welcome day of limited moves in either direction saw the index end the day pretty much where it started. The doji-like candlestick confirms the indecision. The day closed at 5429 with resistance at 5480 and support at 5407 - both levels within yesterday's range. The daily trend remains up, although the shorter timeframes are clearly flat and can best be described as a sideways trend.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The quiet day extended to the safe haven metal which took a breather after yesterday's gentle retracement. Buyers did win out and gained $15 on the day. Support sits at $3210 with a high of $3233. The day closed at $3228. Buyers have continued to confirm demand at every level and retracements continue to be seen as buying opportunities. It appears sellers will require a break below $3200 to initiate any meaningful degree of profit taking.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Not surprisingly, oil also took the day off with very limited activity. Resistance at $65.46 and support at $64.21 were both within yesterday's narrow trading range. A doji-like candle on the charts confirms the rest day. Time will tell whether today's all-round pause can be sustained, or will it be the calm before the storm?

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> The cryptocurrency had an interesting day with sellers prevailing after an early push higher. Buyers broke above the year long descending trendline and established resistance at $86.2K. Once again the high $80K range proved to be unsustainable as sellers stepped in and brough price action back to trade below the trendline area at the end of the day. Bitcoin appears comfortable within the low to mid $80K trading area for now. Although the trend is up technically with EMAs crossed upwards, the bias seems tilted to the downside.
