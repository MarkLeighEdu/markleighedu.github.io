### USD INDEX

While technically the EMAs show the trend remains up, current activity is contradictory. This week sellers dominated convincingly with a red candlestick on the charts. A series of long upper wicks adding to the downward bias, a loosely formed descending triangle and negative USD sentiment signal a lack of demand for the global reserve currency. Resistance at 98.30 with support at 96.86. Note buyers stepped in at this support area in early July 2025.

### S&P 500

A 3rd consecutive doji-like candlestick confirming the lack of direction as neither buyers nor sellers have done enough to signal a new trend for the index. New record highs confirm demand, although unable to break/maintain above current resistance area. With a weak USD, sellers are reluctant to step in and reverse the trend. Resistance at 6542 (record high) with support at 6368.

### GOLD

No indecision, no conflicting, and little doubting the strong demand for the safe haven commodity. Buyers were relentless in going on to setting new record highs with sellers remaining on the sidelines. While profit taking will enter the picture at some point, the lack of previous technical levels within this new unchartered territory sees buyers adding to the trend in a one-sided battle. Support sits at $3437 with resistance at a record high $3601. A weak USD, coupled with strong, yet nervous equity markets, all contributing to the current rally.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers won out on the week, erasing the gains made over the previous 2 weeks. The trend remains down with the bias tilted to the downside as well. The weekly high can also be seen as a lower high on the weekly charts. Note that the current support area held strong, protected by buyers over the last month. Support sits at $65.05 with resistance at $69.58.

### BITCOIN

Buyers won out this week - stepped in and halted the previous 3 week decline. However, looking at the green weekly candlestick in perspective: the downtrend remains intact with buyers unable to take out the previous week high. Resistance at $113.3K with support at $106.9K. Note relevance of the current support area matches the resistance area tested in Dec 2024 and Jan 2025. Sellers will aim to test the significant $100K level.
