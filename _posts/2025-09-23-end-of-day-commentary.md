### USD INDEX

Sellers continued from yesterday and added to the sell-off. Resistance at 97.06 with support at 96.83. Note the support has proved to be a strong floor with buyers guarding it on several attemps since July this year. While the EMAs hang on to signal an uptrend (only just), bias and sentiment appear to be tilted to the downside.

### S&P 500

Rather that the traditional inverse relationship between weak USD and strong equities, today sellers dominated as the S&P was sold off through the day resulting in the 2 major instruments both moving in the same direction (lower).  Note the double top candlestick pattern (reversal sign). The retracement is confirmed, which perhaps will be a signal for profit taking to enter the equation. Resistance at 6755 with support at 6700.

### GOLD

Although buyers did take a breather and we saw a gentle retracement, this was not before buyers set a new record high earlier in the day. Technically the uptrend continues with classic higher highs and higher lows displayed on the charts. Support at $3736 with resistance established at $3794. To date neither profit taking, overbought technicals, nor any particular relationship with the USD have had an effect on the demand for the safe haven commodity.

### BRENT OIL

Following 4 consecutive red candlesticks, buyers stepped in today with a strong bounce up off the support area. Resistance at $67.40 with support at $65.51. Note the strong support area which buyers have protected since June 2025. Next upside target is above $68 which will coincide with a break above the descending trendline on the daily chart.

### BITCOIN

Another strong day for sellers with the established downtrend appearing to pick up steam with a 5th consecutive day of lower highs on the chart. Resistance at $113.3K with support set at $111.5K. While sellers will aim to test $110K, buyers will look up to retake the $113K level. Trend and bias firmly pointing downwards.
