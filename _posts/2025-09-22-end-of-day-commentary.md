### USD INDEX

Sellers controlled the day's activity selling USD across the board. Friday's gains were reversed with today's double top (reversal sign) signalling a potential lower high on the daily charts. Also note price action returned to trade below the descending trendline. While technically the uptrend remains in place (EMAs up), the bias and sentiment favour the downside. Resistance at 97.46 with support set at 96.95

### S&P 500

In keeping with the traditional inverse relationship between weak USD and strong equities, the S&P went on to extend the uptrend with a higher high and higher low on the charts. Further, note that the resistance sits at a new record high as demand for US equities continues into the new week. Support at 6695 with resistance established at 6755.

### GOLD

This record-breaking rally picked up steam to start the week with seemingly little in the way of the unprecedented demand for the metal. Technicals, fundamentals, sentiment all contributing to the one-way traffic. With no previous resistance levels to caution buyers, it seems that the market will need a combination of profit-taking and a USD rally to halt, or at least slow down the gold frenzy. Support at $3685 with resistance at $3748 (new record high).

### BRENT OIL

Sellers were first out the block during the European session, only for buyers to step in and recoup losses, closing alongside Friday's close. Technically the sellers did win out and the downtrend remains intact. Note the strong floor/support as buyers continue to guard this level. Resistance at $66.66 with support lower at $65.35. Bias tilted to the downside.

### BITCOIN

Sellers put in a strong day with a meaningful sell-off adding to the established downtrend. Resistance at $115.4K with support at $111.7K. Note the relevance of the current support level - support August 2nd 2025 and resistance 22nd May 2025. Sellers will aim below $112K with an eye on $107K, with buyers aiming above $117K with an eye on $118K.
