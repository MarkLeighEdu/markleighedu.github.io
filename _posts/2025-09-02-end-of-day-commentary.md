### USD INDEX

Buyers stepped in at current support levels for the 3rd time since mid August 2025 with a strong push higher in the early sessions. However, the rally was short-lived as sellers took control in the US session and reversed much of the gains. The downtrend remains intact (EMAs pointing down) with the bias continuing to be tilted to the downside. Try as they might, buyers have not been able to reverse the negative sentiment surrounding the dollar. Resistance at 98.24 with support at 97.57.

### S&P 500

Following a strong early sell-off, buyers stepped in and regained control in the US session. Note the similarities, or rather opposite pattern - inverse relationship - with the USDX performance where sellers stepped in to reverse the early trend. Buyers have guarded current support levels, although the downtrend remains in place. Demand for US equities continue to prevail as seen in the record highs set last week. Resistance at 6480 with support lower at 6371.

### GOLD

A record setting rally saw demand for the safe-haven commodity going on to set new highs as sellers stood on the sidelines. Neither overbought technical indicators or profit taking were able to reverse the momentum. Uncertainty regarding the USD and equity markets, as reflected in sharp intraday reversals, add to the demand. Support at $3468 with resistance set at $3539. As long as demand prevails the lack of previous resistance levels may continue to see buyers set new highs as prices move within unchartered territory, without guidelines for technical traders to work with.

### BRENT OIL

Demand for oil sees a continuation of the uptrend with higher highs and higher lows on the charts. Resistance set at $69.47 with support lower at $68.14. Buyers will aim to test the $70 mark as sellers will aim below $68 in an attempt to reverse the trend. The current trend sees traders being wary of supply concerns, as opposed to the concerns relating to tariff damage and an economic slowdown.

### BITCOIN

Support held strong as buyers put in a meaningful push higher, doing just enough to reverse the trend on the daily chart. Support sits at $108.4K with resistance established at $111.7K. Note the relevance of the current resistance level - matching the high from May 22 2025 when sellers stepped in, as well as matching support from August 2nd 2025.
