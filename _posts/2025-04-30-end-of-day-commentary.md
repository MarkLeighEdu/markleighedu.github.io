### USD INDEX

Buyers added to yesterdays small gain with a solid push higher to test 99.49, the resistance level which has been in place since last week. While the uptrend remains intact, sideways would be a more accurate description of the trend and direction. With support at 98.93 the chart confirms neither side has been able to build on daily moves as price action remains constrained within the narrow range. RSI reading is 41 which may tilt the bias downward for now.

### S&P 500

Following the release of weak data (negative GDP) early in the US session, buyers stepped in, recouped losses and went on to close marginally higher for the 6th consecutive day. Support sits at 5456 with resistance at 5601. Today's fightback added to the steady uptrend and confirmed that there is demand across the equity markets, as traders look for reasons to remain optimistic as long as there are no new tariff related statements to panic the markets.

### GOLD

As the USDX and equity markets moved higher, the traditional inverse relationship between gold and its counter indices saw the metal add to its current downtrend. Sellers were held up at the $3260 support area before closing at $3288. While the retracement is clear on the charts, sentiment and demand still remains positive for the commodities safe have status - perhaps buyers are waiting for a turnaround in the USDX to signal renewed buying interest. Price action has not wavered too far from the $3300 level which appears to look pivotal for buyers and sellers.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers continued the strong sell-off for the 3rd consecutive day setting support at $60.76 with buyers making no attempt to step in and reverse the trend. Lack of supply concerns coupled with weak financial data and trade wars/tariff concerns all add to the lack of demand. Sellers will aim below $60 while buyers will at a minimum, look to establish a floor at the current $61 support area.

### BITCOIN

Price action was contained within a narrow trading range for the 8th consecutive day - within the $93K - $95K area. From a technical perspective the trend is up with the EMAs gently crossed upwards, an RSI reading of 66, both indicating that the bias does have an upside tilt?slightly, to say the least. Buyers continue to look up to test and break above $96K while sellers look below the $92 area.
