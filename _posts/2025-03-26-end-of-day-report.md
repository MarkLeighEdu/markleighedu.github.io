<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Buyers were in control after yesterdays pause in the uptrend and went on to set resistance at 104.28. Note this level has served as previous resistance in July and October 2024. The strong USD is in keeping with the inverse relationship between USD and equities. While buyers aim to maintain above 104, sellers will look to test the 103.83 support. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Although the uptrend remains intact on the daily charts, sellers stepped in at 5837 resistance and formed a clear double top (reversal signal) erasing the previous 2 days gains and establishing support at 5742. The S&P continues reacting to haphazard tariff updates and clearly the market is uneasy leading up to the April 2 Liberation Day. While buyers look for a bounce up and retake 5800 on the upside, sellers are faced with maintaining below 5750.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The metal traded sideways in a tight range for the 3rd consecutive day. Buyers have maintained above $3000 and in so doing have established a gentle series of higher lows with the $3030 resistance area holding strong. While the demand for the safe haven commodity has eased, a lack of sellers has prevented the year long rally from a meaningful reversal. When the USD strengthens gold appears to hold steady, yet USD weakness creates demand and buying ensues.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Buyers were strong again and added to the uptrend. The $72.40 level acts as support with resistance at $73.50. Sellers will note the fib retracement tool measuring the downtrend from $81.65 down to $68.34 - with the first fib retracement level (38.2%) now being tested and a possible bounce down from this area. Buyers will aim to add to the series of higher highs and higher lows, as well as noting the fundamentals - wars in Ukraine and Middle east and supply concerns all factoring into further demand for oil.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Another quiet day on the crypto front as bitcoin traded in a relatively narrow range between $86K and $88.3K. Taking a step back, the uptrend remains in place with a series of higher lows building up to break above the $88K resistance area. The tight range could signal an imminent breakout. ATR is currently a modest $3.5K and RSI is measuring 50. Technically it feels like a break is coming.
