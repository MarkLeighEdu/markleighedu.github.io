### USD INDEX

Following a slight gap down to open, the USD remained stable today closing alongside the open with a doji-like candlestick confirming the lack of direction. Although buyers were not able to add to yesterday's bounce, noticeably sellers did not step in to continue with the week-long selloff and add to the downtrend. Note this is the 3rd attempt at current support since mid 2025. Resistance at 96.52 with support at 95.84.

### S&P 500

A steep early sell-off did not stick as buyers stepped in through the afternoon portion of the US session, recouping losses and closing back at the open. The doji candlestick confirms the day's activity. The trend remains up with buyers again looking to break, and maintain above to 7000 mark. Resistance at 7029 with support at 6898.

### GOLD

A volatile day starting with a sharp $400+ drop in just an hour early in the US session. However, buyers stepped in and went onto recoup the losses and close alongside yesterday's close price. The candlestick is red as a result of the gap up to start the day. Notwithstanding, another new consecutive record high for the day. As has been the case throughout the metal's historic rally, retracements and pull backs continue to be seen as new buying opportunities to join the trend. Resistance at $5595 with support at $5093.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers controlled the activity adding to the week-long uptrend. Note the pivotal $70 mark was broken. Driving the demand appears to be continuing threats from Trump re. Iran and potential supply concerns which could develop. Buyers will look up to the next resistance at $72.73 (July 31 2025). Resistance at $70.55 with support at $67.51

### BITCOIN

Following weeks of sideways activity with buyers unable to bounce back from the strong bouts of selling, today saw sellers take a major step to continuing and adding to the downward bias. The $6K sell-off picked up momentum all through the day with support ultimately matching lows last seen in November 2025. Next downside target sits at $80.5K (November 21 2025). The 2025 low reads $74K. Trend, bias and sentiment all favour the downside. Buyers defending the support area will look to grind back to the $88K area in upcoming sessions. Resistance at $89.1K with support at $83.2K.
