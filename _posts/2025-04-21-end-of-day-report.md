<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The index opened with a gap down to start the week, opening at 98.55. Sellers were quick to add to the downtrend and establish support at 97.67 - a low not seen since 2021. Uncertainty and negative US sentiment surround the USD, and all the major FX pairs confirmed the dollar sell-off. However, sellers were unable to push lower through the US session as buyers stepped in and bounced up off support, recouped a small portion of the losses and managed to close at 98.13. While buyers will look up to the 99 level, sellers remain in control and will be eyeing below the 98 mark.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> The equity markets started the week in selling mode and buyers stood on the sidelines as a nervous and uncertain market reacted to a negative tariff (China) environment as well as internal political turmoil spurred on by the Trump Powell spat which clearly unnerved the markets. The S&P traded down to 5126 before a late rally managed to set the close at 5191. The sharp move lower was enough to reverse the trend with the EMAs crossing to the downside.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Again we saw the familiar patter, a gap up to start the trading day, a new record high and a huge $80+ gain in a single day. Resistance now sits at $3433 with intraday support at $3349. Golds safe haven status continues to invoke demand at every level. As long as the U$ and equity markets continue to be surrounded by the overall negative US sentiment, investors have not found an alternative investment to replace the traditional US/safety economic environment. The two factors which could pause, if not halt the rally appear to be the overbought technical reading (RSI 77) and a bout of profit taking from savvy traders who recognize a natural retracement is long overdue.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Following a gap down to start the week, sellers added to the move lower and went on to set support at $64.74. Buyers did step in and bounced up to establish resistance at $65.59. The uptrend remains intact with the bias slightly favouring the upside. Buyers will target $66.46 to remain on track, while sellers look below $65. The conflicting factors remain global economic uncertainty coupled with trade wars, as opposed to supply concerns related to geopolitical unrest becoming an issue.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> A strong day for the cryptocurrency which started on the front foot and went on to maintain demand and close noticeably higher than last week. Support sits at $85.2K as buyers established a closing price of $87.2K. Resistance at $88.5K. Buyers will aim to break above the $88K level and more importantly, maintain the high $80K area while eyeing the $90K level. Trend is up, bias is up and perhaps bitcoin can establish a sense of "safety investment" having held its own through the recent financial turmoil. Sellers will look below $85K.
