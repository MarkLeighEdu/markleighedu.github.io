### USD INDEX

A powerful showing saw buyers in full control from start to finish. Technicals show a 3rd consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows as buyers broke above significant levels. Resistance at 98.34 with support at 97.82. Perhaps ironic that the lack of data (government shutdown) has confirmed demand for the USD.

### S&P 500

Following the typical inverse relationship between strong dollar and weak equities, the index was sold off today with sellers maintaining control. Technically we see a triple top and today's bearish engulfing candlestick all confirming the turn around with EMAs crossing to the downside. Resistance at 6802 with support at 6746.

### GOLD

A continuation of what we've seen since the start of September 2025. Buyers confirming demand for the safe haven commodity with a series of new daily highs, and but for the occasional short bouts of profit taking, it's been one-way traffic as the rally continues. Resistance at $3990 with support at $3940. The $4000 mark appears to be clearly in view. Even a strong USD hasn't been able to derail the trend.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers withstood intraday volatility to end the day higher and added to the 3-day mini rally. Resistance at $65.82 with support at $64.54. Note the close alongside yesterday's close price. The trend remains down with buyers aiming above $66 as a first goal in an attempt to reverse the trend.

### BITCOIN

In response to yesterday's record high, sellers stepped in and reversed a comfortable portion of the recent gains. Resistance at $125.1K with support established at $120.6K. Notwithstanding the push lower, the uptrend remains intact on the dailies, with the 4hr chart signalling a sharp reversal, enough to cross the EMAs downward. Current levels ($122K) may provide a further opportunity for sellers to join the profit taking mood, while buyers may recognize the lower price as a new buying opportunity.
