<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> USD weakness to start the new month as sellers picked up from where they left off last week. Negative sentiment continues to impact the dollar with limited demand for the global currency. Resistance at 97.79 with support lower at 97.46. Note this is the 3rd attempt at the current support level since last month. Price activity has been contained within the 97.50 - 98.50 range since August 1 2025.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> US stock markets were closed for Labour day. In the futures market we saw a gap up to start followed initially by a sell-off, and then buyers recouping the majority of the losses to close slightly lower than the open. The red daily candlestick gives little indication of direction going into the new month. Resistance at 6491 with support set at 6458.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> A 5th consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows added to the strong uptrend with a record high close to start the new month. Buyers eying the $3500 high set in April 2025. A weak USD, political uncertainty both globally and on the US front contributing to the demand for the safe haven commodity. Sellers remaining on the sidelines for now. Support at $3436 with resistance established at $3490.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Buyers won out today with a gentle push higher as price action remained within the $67 - $68 range. Support at $67.08 with resistance set at $68.36. The EMAs show the uptrend remains intact with trading activity a leg higher than we saw through the first half of August. The bias has an upward feel with buyers prevailing as the default direction.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Limited activity as the cryptocurrency closed within a narrow range for the 3rd consecutive day. Support at $107.2K with resistance at $109.9K. Note the body of the candlestick is confined to a tight $600 range - difference between open and close price. The downtrend remains in place with the bias pointed down. The reactionary bounces following the strong sell-offs appear to be more of a technical nature than fundamental demand for the digital currency. Note the current support area held as a strong floor earlier in July 2025.
