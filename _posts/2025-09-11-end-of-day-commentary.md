### USD INDEX

The brief 2-day fight back stood no chance as sellers regained control and ended the day in familiar support territory. Resistance at 97.60 with support set at 97.05. Buyers have guarded this floor through the month. Negative data (jobs, PPI and CPI) coupled with overall negative USD sentiment continue to weigh on the global reserve currency.

### S&P 500

While the USD struggles, demand for US equities is unwavering as the major US stock markets continue to set record highs. S&P saw sellers continue to stand on the sidelines with neither overbought technicals or profit taking having an impact on the rally. The succession of higher highs and higher lows confirm the textbook uptrend playing out. Support sits at 6591 with resistance established at 6654.

### GOLD

Following a brief sell-off early in the Asian and European sessions, buyers stepped in at the US session and went on to recoup the majority of the losses. While the uptrend remains firmly intact it does appear that the market is taking a breather as buyers have not tested the recent record highs from earlier in the week. Support at $3614 with resistance at $3650. Demand for the safe haven commodity remains in place with buyers maintaining control. As long as the fundamentals and technicals remain aligned, bouts of selling continue to be brief without any follow through.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers took control from the outset, going on to reverse the gains from the previous 2 days and in so doing, reversed the brief uptrend. End of day close saw prices settling at the strong support area that sellers have struggled to break, and maintain below over the past week. Resistance at $67.63 with support lower at $66.15. Both buyers and sellers have distinct levels to test with an ascending and descending trendline set up to contain moves in respective directions.

### BITCOIN

Buyers added to the uptrend with slight gains and a higher high and higher low on the charts. Bias and sentiment favour the upside as sellers have made no move to reverse the trend. Support at $113.6K with resistance set at $114.8K. Next upside target sits at $117K (August 22nd 2025). Note the current resistance does match support from July 25th 2025.
