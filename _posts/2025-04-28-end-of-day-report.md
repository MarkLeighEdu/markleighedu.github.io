<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Last weeks mini rebound was cancelled out as the USD sell-off resumed today with the index and FX majors all confirming the lack of confidence in the previously unchallenged global reserve currency. Lack of demand saw sellers establish support at 98.68, with 97.67 again in view. With a variety of negative fundamental and technical influences adding to the downturn, perhaps the sentiment factor is the main driver as Trumps policies have been met with universal disapproval as reflected in the lack of demand for US Treasuries. Buyers will look above to regain the 99.00 level in an attempt to reverse todays move lower.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Another volatile day in the stock markets closed with the S&P putting in a late charge to close higher on the day. Resistance sits at 5582 and in so doing added a 5th consecutive higher high and maintained above the significant 5500 mark. While buyers look up to the 5800 area, sellers will aim to break below todays support at 5491.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Sellers re-tested the $3260 area early before buyers stepped in with a strong intraday rally to establish resistance at $3252 - a significant $50 gain from the pivotal $3300 open price. Todays price action confirmed the demand for the commodities safe haven status at every level as retracements and pull-backs continue to be seen as new buying opportunities. From a technical perspective its noteworthy that the relative sideways range between $3260 and $3360 has been maintained for 4 consecutive days. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Sellers maintained the early sell-off and went on to establish support at $64.16, significantly closing below the $65 level. While sellers will now aim below $64, buyers will look up to re-test the $66.30 resistance level. Taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, the sideways trend continues with neither buyers or sellers adding to recent daily moves. Perhaps it is new developments on the geopolitical front which will create a meaningful trend as opposed to technical indicators on their own merit.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Buyers won out on the day after testing both ends of the range. Resistance sits at $95.6 with support at $92.7 - a relatively narrow $3K range. After a slight sell-off in weekend trading, todays close matches the Friday close - so basically back where it started. Noteworthy that the last sideways activity between April 12 - April 20 was followed by a significant push higher. Should that pattern repeat itself, the next push higher could see the $100K level come into view. The trend remains up and todays green candlestick suggests the bias is tilted to the upside. Sellers will be aiming to break below the $94K mark.
