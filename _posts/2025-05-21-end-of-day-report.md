<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The 4th consecutive day of lower lows and lower highs adding to the well-established downtrend. Resistance sits at 99.83 with support set at 99.18. Buyers did step in late to recoup a portion of the losses, closing at 99.47. With little in the way of new data releases or trade deals, again it seems that the weight of all-round negative US sentiment continues to weigh on the USD.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Sellers took control from the outset and picked up momentum right through to the close. Resistance sits at 5956 with support established at 5846. The strong sell-off took out the previous 5 days lows and was enough to initiate a crossover with the EMAs now signalling a downtrend. Note the support matches the resistance reached March 25th. Interesting that the major equity markets moved (lower) in the same direction as the USDX.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Steady demand for the safe haven commodity continued today with buyers in control for the 3rd consecutive day. Support sits at the $3287 open with resistance established at $3326. The weak USD and equity sell-off both contributed to the traditional inverse relationship between gold and those major indices. While buyers continue to look up at $3500 resistance, sellers will aim to break below $3300 as a first target on the downside.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Sellers won out in a steady sell-off from $65.95 resistance down to the $64.08 close/support level. While the push lower was enough to signal a downtrend with the EMAs crossing down, and the bias tilted to the downside, price action remains contained within a relatively narrow $2 range between $64 and $66. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Bitcoin continued its strong showing and went on to setting a new record high at $109.8K. Support sits at $106.1K. The technical indicators, coupled with the positive sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies all contributed to the upside breakout. Once buyers look above $110K and enter unchartered territory, the lack of resistance and support levels could see sharp moves higher. Pull backs and retracements will see sellers look below $106K at a minimum, to break the series of higher lows on the daily chart.
