### USD INDEX

The USD traded in a tight range between 102.86 and 103 41 with a slight upward bias. Although the buyers won out the day, the lower high added to the strong downtrend. The move appeared more of a breather than a demand for U$. Sentiment remains negative.

### S&P 500

The major US equity markets had another volatile day with tariffs again causing unsettling market behaviour. Trump calls his constant altering flexibility, the markets call it uncertainty and if there's one thing we know as traders, markets do not like uncertainty. Support was set at 5601 while buyers established resistance at 5726. Although the charts show a higher high, higher low and a green candlestick, the downtrend remains intact.

### GOLD

The metal added to yesterdays reversal to the upside and reached as high as $2941, a $60 rally in just 2 days. Gold safe haven status amid geopolitical uncertainty and a weak USD both contributed to the demand. Buyers will be eyeing the record high of $2954 set last month.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers added to yesterdays bounce up off support with a strong push higher to reach the $71 mark. The 2 day reversal could be more than just sellers taking a breather should fundamental issues add to the technical picture -supply concerns and geopolitical tensions - creating demand for buyers. Buyers will aim to test and break above the $71.38 resistance mark.

### BITCOIN

In a relatively narrow trading range between $80.4K and $84.5K, buyers were able to maintain the upper hand, but just slightly. Sellers could see todays high as a lower high when looking at the big picture. Sellers will aim to retest the $80K support area.
