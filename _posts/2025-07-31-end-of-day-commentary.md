### USD INDEX

Buyers maintained control for a 6th consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows adding to the uptrend. Resistance set at 99.88 with support below at 99.28. Neither overbought technical indicators, bouts of profit-taking or negative USD sentiment have interrupted the rally. With the 100.00 mark clearly in view, it seems a new fundamental factor needs to enter the equation for sellers to step in.

### S&P 500

Sellers made a statement today with a strong push lower adding to the downtrend - notwithstanding a brief early record high for the index. Resistance at 6471 with support established at 6356. While today was the 4th consecutive lower low on the chart, it remains to be seen whether the retracement is just that, or further develops into a meaningful reversal.

### GOLD

Buyers did enough to win out the day, but it was unconvincing. Although the daily candlestick is green, the chart shows a lower high adding to the downtrend. Resistance set at $3315 with support matching yesterday's close at $3272. Note that the safe haven commodity was unable to maintain above the pivotal $3300 level. As long as the USD continues its strong rally, it seems gold will struggle to find buyers.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers put an end to this week's run up and in so doing set up the foundation of a double top, which is a strong reversal sign. Resistance sits at yesterday's close - $72.81 with support lower at $70.89. Note the higher low which adds to the uptrend.

### BITCOIN

Sellers won the day convincingly from a technical perspective, with a close below $117K. Resistance set at $118.9K with support at $116K. While sellers look to add to today's sell-off and aim below $114K, buyers look up to regain $119K on the upside. The loosely formed descending triangle favours the downside.
