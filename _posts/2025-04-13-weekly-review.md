### USD INDEX

Not only did the USD selloff continue from the previous week, it picked up steam and went on to drop a huge 3% which saw the index reach lows not seen since March 2022. After starting the week at 102.46, sellers took the White House tariff pause as a sign of panic and uncertainty as fundamentals, technicals and Fridays Consumer sentiment report all aligned to see support established at 98.78. The Bond market looked to confirm that the US could be losing its grip as the worlds economic safe house. Buyers will look up to the 100 level as the first upside target.

### S&P 500

The equity markets had a volatile and haphazard week but closed on a front footing with buyers in control. The S&P recouped most of the previous week's losses and confirmed the inverse relationship with the falling USD. With support at 4842 buyers broke above 5000 and went on to set resistance at 5534. The charts confirm the downtrend still intact with the candlestick showing a lower high. From a trading perspective we saw regular gaps after the close, pre market and subsequent opening prices.

### GOLD

Following last weeks breather and a gentle retracement after an historic year long rally, buyers stepped in at the $2956 support and bought the safe haven commodity without letting up, regardless of the price. After $100+ and $90+ daily moves, resistance now sits at $3238. While technically overbought (RSI 76) and a natural expectation for profit taking, it appears that demand will persist as long as jitters surround the USD and uncertainty and nervousness continue in the equity markets.

### BRENT OIL

While buyers closed the week higher, with a green candlestick as proof, the charts confirm the extreme selloff over the past 2 weeks. While resistance sits at $67.47, levels last seen in 2021, support was established at $58.58. Although the bounce was welcomed, the fear of a global economic slowdown leading to a recession and lack of demand is dominating the price action. While geopolitical issues appear to have taken a backseat to economic issues, it seems it will take supply concerns coming to the fore as a reason to reverse, or at least pause the move lower.

### BITCOIN

Buyers won out the week following a $12K trading range with support at $74.4K and resistance established at $86.2K. While the bounce signals the EMAs crossing to the upside, the charts do show a lower high and lower low. Buyers will aim above $88K while sellers look below at the low $80K area. Noteworthy that the cryptocurrency did not attract investor interest as a safe haven investment amidst the turmoil in spite of the fact that the White House has clearly been vocal in their support of crypto and the US being touted as the crypto capital of the world. From September last year when Trump was on the election trail bitcoin rose dramatically - $60K to $109K. Following Trump's inauguration, the currency has reversed to as low as the $70K area. Current support matches the same level which served as resistance in March 2024.
