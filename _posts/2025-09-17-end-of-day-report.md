<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Following an initial drop in response to the Fed's 25 bpc rate cut, the USD fought back and went onto close higher than the open with a daily green candlestick confirming the bounce. However, seen in perspective: the downtrend remains intact with a lower high and lower low on the daily charts. The resilience displayed by the world's reserve currency will be seen as a positive for dollar bulls, while recognizing there is along way to go in reversing the trend. Sellers will note today signalled a multi-year low on the charts. Support sits at 95.82 with resistance at 96.67.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Although the index sold off initially, buyers recouped most of the losses signalling that the dovish rate cut (25 bps) does not appear to have reversed the strong demand for US equities. While the charts do reflect a lower high and lower low on the charts, the late recovery saw a close price not far off the current record high levels. Support sits at 6611 with resistance established higher at 6687.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Gold was the big loser on the day with a strong sell-off following the Fed's rate cut (25 bps) with buyers unable to fight back and sellers maintaining control throughout the session. Factors influencing the slide was perhaps a combination of the resilience shown by the USD, as well as sellers finally taking profit after the record setting one-way rally which kicked in August 20th 2025. Next target on the downside is $3612. However, the metal has surely not lost its safe haven status (after all, we did see an all-time high early in the day) and buyers may well see the lower price as a buying opportunity. Support at $3644 with resistance at $3709. Note the bearish engulfing candlestick pattern which is a strong reversal signal.   

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Sellers won out today and went on to reverse over half of the gains from yesterday's move higher. The uptrend remains in place with a higher low on the daily charts. Support established at $67.60 with resistance at $68.59. While buyers continue to look up at targeting the $70 mark, sellers will look to add to today's sell-off on the way to targeting $67 and reversing the uptrend. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Sellers reversed much of yesterday's gains as price action continues to trade within a now well-established $2.7K range. Mixed signals see the uptrend remain in place (EMAs) although practically the trend moves sideways with neither buyers or sellers doing enough to set a new trend/direction. Looking at previous sideways price action, the tendency does favour a break to the upside. Support sits at $114.7 with resistance at $117.3K.
