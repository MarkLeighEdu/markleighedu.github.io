<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The USD had a solid day following up from Friday's bounce up off 101 support and in so doing shaped a 3rd consecutive day of higher lows and went on to set resistance at 103.21. Buyers will be aiming for pre-tariff levels of 104 while sellers look below 102. While USD sentiment remains negative the technicals do reflect demand for the worlds global currency as reflected in the index as well as the US$ gains against the major currency pairs. Another positive for the USD is the volatile and uncertainty surrounding the stock markets tied to the traditional inverse relationship between equities and the USD. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> After a large gap down to start the week, sellers established support at 4842 before buyers stepped in and raced up to 5286. The rally was short lived as sellers stepped in to close the day at 5091, alongside Friday's close. With rumours and uncertainty creating volatility and panic, perhaps the unemotional technical indicators are our best guide moving forward. Notwithstanding the green daily candlestick the downtrend was extended with lower highs and lower lows on the charts. In current conditions the 5100 level is shaping up to be pivotal.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The strong reversal continued for the 3rd consecutive day as sellers controlled activity and kept price action mostly below the pivotal $3000 level, with support set at $2984. Note the low for the day at $2956 matches the February high from earlier this year. Although the technical reversal is clear on the charts, the elements of profit taking and overbought conditions do not deter from the metals safe haven status and buyers may see current levels as a buying opportunity should the technicals indicate a bounce up on the shorter time frames. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Although todays candlestick is green, the technical picture reflects a strong downtrend with a 4th consecutive day of lower highs and lower lows. The factors contributing to the selloff are the fears of an economic slowdown resulting from the trade wars, and ultimately a global recession. The support at $62.48 was last seen in 2021. As price activity remains in uncharted territory below $68, buyers have struggled to find a floor. From a technical perspective buyers will look up to resistance at $67.45 as a first real goal in reversing the trend. Fundamentally supply concerns tied to global geopolitical conflict would contribute to demand.   

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Price activity widened to a $7K range between $74.2K on the downside and $81.2K on the upside, only to end the day pretty close to where it started at $78.6K. The trend remains down and the bias also appears tilted to the downside as price action resulted in a close below $80K. While buyers look up to $85K sellers will aim for the low $70K area, levels not seen in 2025. From a fundamental perspective, buyers will be looking to the White House to talk up the cryptocurrency.
