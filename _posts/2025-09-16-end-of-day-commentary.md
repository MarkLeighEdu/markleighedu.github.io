### USD INDEX

Sellers added to the downtrend with a strong push lower breaking the support which buyers had managed to protect since mid July. Resistance at 96.98 with support established at 96.16. Note the close matching July 1 2025. The market anticipates, and appears to have priced in a 25 bps rate cut at tomorrows Fed meeting.

### S&P 500

Although the index went onto set yet another record high, demand did let up as sellers were able to halt the rally and close alongside yesterday's close with limited activity as the market takes a breather before tomorrow's Fed announcement. Resistance at 6696 with support set lower at 6661.

### GOLD

Regardless of any other asset's performance, demand for the metal continues with yet another all-time record high established. Gold's safe haven status continues to attract buyers from both a fundamental and technical perspective. Support sits at $3673 with resistance at $3704. As jitters surround the outcome of the Fed's immanent rate cut and a weak USD reflects the negative sentiment surrounding the global reserve currency, gold continues to move higher in unchartered territory with little in the form of boundaries to contain the surge - either fundamentally or technically.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers maintained control with a 3rd consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows on the chart. Noteworthy that today's move broke the descending trendline which was in place since June 2025. Support at $67.03 with resistance at $68.72. Buyers will look up to the $70 mark while sellers look below $68 as a first target in an attempt to reverse the trend.

### BITCOIN

Buyers had a strong day maintaining control from the outset with sellers remaining on the sidelines. Support at $114.6K with resistance at $116.9K. While the uptrend remains intact, price action continues to trade sideways with both sides contained within a narrow $2.5K range. Bias continues to be tilted to the upside. Buyers will again test the $117K level with sellers aiming below $114K.
