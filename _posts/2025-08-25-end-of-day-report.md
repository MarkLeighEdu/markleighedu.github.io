<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Buyers started the week on the front foot as demand for USD saw the index recoup much of Friday's sell-off and re-establishing the uptrend from last week. Support sits at 97.62 with resistance higher at 98.42. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> The rally from Friday did not continue into the new week as sellers won out on the day, all be it in the form of a mild retracement rather than a strong reversal. The push lower appeared to be more a case of limited demand rather than sellers re-entering the market. Resistance at 6487 with support at 6461.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The metal traded within a relatively narrow $17 range with neither buyers or sellers winning out, with the price closing at $3368, alongside Friday's close. Resistance at $3376 with support at $3359. The trend and bias point upwards as gold did show resilience in the face a strong USD.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Another positive day for oil as buyers maintain the move higher with a 5th consecutive day of higher lows adding to the uptrend. While demand continues buyers will be eying the $70 mark on the upside. Noteworthy that as the other major indices and currencies continue to trade haphazardly with daily trend reversals, the push higher in oil has been slow, but steady and consistent. Support at $67 with resistance at $68.47.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Sellers controlled the day's activity with a strong push lower adding to the established downtrend. Resistance at $113.7K with support lower at $110.5K. Note the support matches yesterday's low. Further, the fact that current support has been tested as a resistance previously does make it a relevant level. Sellers will be aiming below $110K.
