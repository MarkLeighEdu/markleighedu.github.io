<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Sellers extended yesterday's sell-off with another push lower, and in so doing initiated a new downtrend on the charts (EMAs crossed down). US December consumer confidence report contributed - 89.1 v 90.1 expected. Today's low matches that from December 16 2025. Resistance at 97.87 with support at 97.50.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> The "santa rally" continues to give with the index trading at record highs going into Christmas eve. A 4th consecutive higher high and higher low on the charts adding to the uptrend. The upside target of 7000 before year-end? Profit taking has not yet entered the picture as sellers remain on the sidelines. Resistance at $6965 with support at 6921. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The familiar 2025 pattern continues? another day and a new record high for the safe haven commodity. Adding $40 to yesterday's record high and as yet, no sign of profit taking and apparent disregard for the overbought technical reading (RSI 80!). Resistance at $4499 with support at $4430.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Buyers continued with the impressive fight back for the 3rd consecutive day. While the overall trend maintains a downward bias, the current trend has crossed to the upside (EMAs up). What started as a technical bounce now appears to have fundamental support with geopolitical conflicts (middle east, Russia/Ukraine, Venezuela) adding to potential supply concerns. Note the descending trendline which coincides with the $64 area. Resistance at $62.05 with support at $61.32.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Following yesterday's failed attempt on the upside, sellers won out today taking out the lows from the past 4 days. Trend, bias (and possibly sentiment as well) all tilted to the downside going into Christmas eve. To date BTC has never recovered from the 2 month sell-off through October and November which saw the cryptocurrency dive from a $126K high (October 6 2025) down to $80.4K (November 21 2025). Currently the $85K - $87K area appears to be a comfort zone as the sideways activity continues. Resistance at $88.9K with support at $86.6K.
