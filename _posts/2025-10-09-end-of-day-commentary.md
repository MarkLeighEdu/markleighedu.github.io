### USD INDEX

Today saw the USD rally across the board as the US government shutdown has coincided with the global reserve currency's sharp 4-day rally. Lack of data (no news is good news) has left the door open for buyers, as technical analysis and a show of strength on the geopolitical front contribute to the current demand. Perhaps a little early to confirm positive sentiment for the dollar, however sellers have yet to make an appearance. Resistance at 99.30 with support at 98.43.

### S&P 500

While the charts confirm that sellers won out on the day, it was not before a new record high was established early on. Buyers and sellers continue to trade punches with price activity showing a sideways trend this week, action contained within a familiar looking range. Resistance at 6812 with support at 6760. Buyers will note the marginally higher highs and higher lows, while sellers note the strength of current resistance area.

### GOLD

Buyers took a well-earned breather with a number of contributors: strong USD push higher, natural retracement following the $4000 break, and an expected bout of profit taking. Note the resulting technical analysis showing a double top, coupled with a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern - both strong reversal signs. Resistance at $4057 with support at $3942.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers put in a strong showing, reversing the gains from the past 3 days. In so doing the EMAs reversed down signalling a new downtrend. Resistance at $66.54 with support at $64.94. Note the familiar support area which buyers have guarded since June 2025. The double top and bearish engulfing patterns both add to the bearish bias.

### BITCOIN

Sellers erased yesterday's gains with a strong push lower, doing enough to reverse the trend with the EMAs crossing to the downside. Note the 4th consecutive lower high on the charts. Resistance at $123.8K with support at $119.7K.
