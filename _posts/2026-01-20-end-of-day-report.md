<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The Greenland threat scared the market; Trump's latest tariff threats sent the USD into a tailspin. Sellers confirmed the panic as the global currency was sold-off sharply during the Asian and European session, with buyers stepping in and recouping a portion of the losses through the US session. Trend and sentiment point downwards after today's move. Resistance at 98.90 with support at 98.01.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> US equity markets stumbled to start the week, and today responded to the Greenland/tariff scenario with a sharp sell-off across the board. The index gained slightly in the futures market and early US session, before sellers went on to make a clear statement in response to the latest geopolitical conflict. Note that buyers were close to the 7000 level at last week's close, and now 2 days later sellers are looking to test the 6800 mark on the downside. Resistance at 6911 with support at 6823.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Unsurprisingly, gold rallied sharply in response to the Greenland situation - confirming the metal's safe-haven status as well as the inverse relationship with a falling USD. A new all-time high was recorded with sellers remaining on the sidelines. Interesting that late last year when gold was trading at $4274 (December 31 2025) analysts were predicting a possible $5K level in 2026. Right now (January 20 2026) buyers are looking at $4800 as the next upside target. Resistance at $4766 with support at $$4658. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> For the 3rd consecutive day there is no clear direction as oil continues to test $65 on the upside, $63.30 on the downside, and settling to close around the $64 level. While the Greenland issue controls the current media, with limited updates on the Iran situation/supply concerns, prices appear to be relatively stable, for now. Resistance at $65.13 and support at $63.37.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Sellers added to the downtrend with a 5th consecutive lower low and a significant close below the $90K level. Lack of demand for the cryptocurrency is noticeable in the current context of geopolitical conflict (Greenland/tariffs) and the USD showing clear signs of instability - BTC unable to attract appeal as a safe-haven alternative. Note today's move breaks the ascending trendline which has been in place since the November 2025 sell-off. Resistance at $92.7K with support at $89.2K.
