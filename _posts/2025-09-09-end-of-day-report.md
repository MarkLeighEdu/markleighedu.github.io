<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Buyers made a strong push up off support and put a temporary halt to the strong downtrend. Technically little has changed with today's green candlestick adding a lower high and lower low to the existing trend. Resistance set at 97.38 with support at 96.83. Note the support area has been well guarded by buyers as sellers failed to break lower for the 3rd time since July 24 2025.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Buyers put in a strong rally late in the US session erasing earlier losses and going on to match the record high levels set late August and earlier this month. The series of consecutive higher lows confirms demand for US equities. Support rests at 6488 with resistance established at 6524. Noteworthy that USD and S&P both moved (higher) in the same direction. Neither profit-taking nor overbought technicals entered the picture. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Following the usual early rally setting new record highs, sellers stepped in aggressively for the first time since August 11 2025 and went onto maintain downward pressure through to the close. Resistance was set at $3674 with support established at $3625. While the uptrend remains intact the 4H chart crossed down following a bearish engulfing candlestick. Note the inverse relationship between strong USD and weak gold. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> A similar pattern to yesterday with buyers starting early, only for sellers to step in and close only slightly above the open. Trend and bias both point downwards with neither side able to maintain intraday moves. Note the 3 consecutive days of higher lows adding to the contradiction on the chart. Resistance at $67.38 with support lower at $66.03. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Sellers won out on the day, closing within a familiar $2.5K daily range for the 8th consecutive day.  Technically the uptrend remains in place with a 3rd consecutive higher high and higher low on the charts. Practically the trend is sideways as buyers remain unable to maintain above $113K and sellers struggle to push below $110K on the downside. Resistance at $113.3K with support at $110.7K.
