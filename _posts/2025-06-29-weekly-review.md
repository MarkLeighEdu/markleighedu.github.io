### USD INDEX

Sellers dominated the activity as the USD was sold off against all the major pairs, with the index reflecting USD weakness across the board. Negative USD sentiment coupled with a lack of confidence in US debt (yields) and assets looking forward, resulted in the USDX trading at lows not seen since early 2022. Resistance sits at 99.03 with support at 96.59.

### S&P 500

Major US equity markets confirmed the inverse relationship between the USD and equities as the S&P hovers at record breaking highs as the USD sell-off continues. The sell-off in yields added to the stock market rally. Resistance established at 6238 with support set at 5990. No news is good news appears to be the theme as steady consistent demand prevails. The market will watch for news on the trade deal front as Trump's July deadline for reciprocal tariffs gets closer.

### GOLD

A solid and consistent sell-off saw gold trade below the significant $3300 level as buyers stood on the sidelines. Note the double-top candlestick formation (strong reversal sign) which played out this week. Resistance sits above at $3339 with support established at $3255. The lack of demand for the metal's safe haven status since the start of the middle east conflict appears contradictory from a fundamental perspective. Buyers may well see the new support level as a higher low when looking at the bigger picture. On the upside buyers will aim above $3300, while sellers look below $3200.

### BRENT OIL

The middle east conflict was the driver which saw oil prices spike $12 from the initial onset (Israel attack on Iran), only to give it all back (US brokered ceasefire) and prices return to the levels we saw before the conflict started. Resistance was established at $77.70 with support set at $66. Current prices have been clinging close to the support area with supply concerns making for a nervous market.

### BITCOIN

Buyers stepped in and recouped the previous weeks losses and in so doing reversed the trend. Resistance sits at $108.6K with support $99.6K. While the bias favours the upside, it is noteworthy that buyers (daily charts) have struggled to break above current resistance levels recently. Buyers aiming for $100K as sellers look below $105K.
