### USD INDEX

Another day with wild swings in both directions. The day got off to an expected bearish start on the first day of Trumps retaliatory tariffs. Support established at 101.56. Midway through the US session the White House announced a 90 day pause, and buyers stepped in to reverse the days losses and go onto set resistance at 103.06. While the trend appears sideways with both EMAs levelled off, the bias remains down. RSI reads 41. Buyers will aim above 103, sellers looking below the 102.50 open price.

### S&P 500

Price action regained above the 5000 mark after sellers initially established support at 4880. A resilient Wall Street then received the 90 day pause in retaliatory tariffs with open arms and the S&P went on to rally into the close setting resistance at 5517. Buyers will be looking up to pre retaliatory levels of 5739. While the sharp move higher reversed the trend, note that RSI remains blow 50 (46), and the response from China (excluded from the 90 day pause) will be learned before the markets open tomorrow.

### GOLD

The safe haven commodity roared back today and rallied over $100 from $2972 support to set resistance at $3097. While buyers will have the record high $3169 in view, sellers will see the pivotal $3000 level as the first target on the downside.

### BRENT OIL

No financial instrument welcomed the pause in retaliatory tariffs more so than did the oil market. What looked like another record low with support set at $58.58, buyers stepped in and after recouping yesterday's losses, went on to establish resistance at $66.07. while the RSI reading is at 38, the bullish engulfing daily candlestick bodes well for the recovery. Buyers will look up to the pivotal $70 level.

### BITCOIN

It took a long time in coming, and buyers took advantage of the tariff news with a strong surge, taking out the previous 2 day's highs on the way to establishing resistance at $82.6K. Technically the engulfing candle and the double bottom are both bullish signals, plus breaking above $80 all add up to a strong day for the cryptocurrency. Buyers will aim for $88K while sellers will look below to the $70K area.
