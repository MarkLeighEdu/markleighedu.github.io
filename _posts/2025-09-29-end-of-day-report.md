<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> A gap lower to start the week, followed by sellers doing enough to end the day lower with a 2nd consecutive red candlestick confirming the retracement with a lower high and lower low on the charts. Notwithstanding the uptrend remains intact. Resistance at 97.79 with support lower at 97.46. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> A volatile day saw an early rally, followed by a sell-off, with buyers making a late run to secure buyers won out on the day with a green candlestick and a higher high and higher low on the chart. Note the downtrend remains in place as a result of last week's 3 day sell-off. Support at 6696 with resistance at 6736.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The metal started the week on the front foot and went on to set a new record high with buyers firmly in control. Sellers remain on the sidelines, demand is unwavering, and no previous resistance levels are all contributing to the one-way rally. Overbought technicals have not had an impact on the rally and it appears that traders are not yet ready to consider profit-taking with the $4000 level clearly in focus. Support at $3764 with resistance at $3833. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Sellers took control from the outset and never gave up on the strong sell-off, doing enough to reverse the trend and establish a new downtrend. Resistance at $68.99 with support established at $66.66. Note the strong resistance level at $69 was again fiercely protected by sellers.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> A strong 2- day rally has seen the cryptocurrency gain $5K ($109.5K - $114.5k) and in so doing establish a new uptrend with the EMAs crossing to the upside. Buyers will aim to break above the descending trendline on the way to re-test the $117 resistance area, while sellers look below $112K as a first goal to re-establish the downtrend. Support at $111.5K with resistance at $114.5K.
