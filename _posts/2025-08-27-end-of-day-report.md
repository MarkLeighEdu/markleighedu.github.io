<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> A day of two halves - the USD was bought through the Asian and European sessions, only to be sold off through the US session, giving up all early gains and closing below the open. While the daily candle is red, the EMAs are at the same level as the sideways trend continues. Again the 98 mark is the current comfort level for the index. Resistance at 98.64 with support below at 98.03.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Buyers maintained control adding to the strong uptrend. A record close as buyers test the record high resistance levels. Demand for US equities across the board as neither profit taking or overbought technicals provide sellers with a reason to step in. Support at 6472 with resistance at 6502. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Demand for the metal continued with buyers adding to yesterday's gains with higher highs and higher lows on the chart. Buyers have tested current resistance levels six times since April, struggling to maintain demand above $3400. The safe haven commodity continues to confirm the traditional inverse relationship between weak USD and strong gold. Support at $3373 with resistance set at $3400.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Following a slow start, buyers stepped in doing enough to end the day with a higher close, a green candlestick and recouping a portion of yesterday's losses. However, note the daily candlestick shows a lower high and lower low on the chart. The current trend remains up within the current sideways activity. Resistance at $67.49 with support set lower at $66.33. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> First sellers and then buyers had a say, neither side able to add to initial pushes, with a final close alongside yesterday's close and a doji-like candlestick confirming the indecision. Support at $110.3K with resistance at $112.6K. The downtrend remains intact and the bias feels tilted to the downside. The $112K area appears to be shaping up as a pivotal level.
