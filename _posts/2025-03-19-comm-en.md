### USD INDEX

Sellers continued to push the index slightly lower, again, and for the 3rd consecutive day we see lower highs and lower lows. Support at 102.83 held without buyers stepping in. Sentiment remains bearish with little demand for USD, perhaps both sides waiting for the Fed decision tomorrow. Sellers will see 103.77 resistance as a lower high on the daily charts. Note the RSI signalling extreme oversold conditions at 28.

### S&P 500

Support turned to resistance as sellers dominated from 5738 and wiped out yesterdays gains to establish support at 5652. Contradictions aplenty with the index moving in the same direction as the USD, EMAs barely still signalling an uptrend, and RSI at 38. Buyers will look up to regain 5700 while sellers push to break below 5600. Notwithsatanding the previous 2 day bounce, sentiment and bias both favour the downside.

### GOLD

The rally from beginning of the month started at $2850 and the metal today reached another new record high at $3039. Higher highs and higher lows continue as the classic uptrend continues. The pattern has confirmed demand at all levels with little standing in the way of buyers. However, a technical RSI reading of 72 signals extreme overbought conditions and profit taking is also a consideration. Dips and natural retracements will be seen as new buying opportunities while sellers will look for technical signs of a reversal on the shorter time frames.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers started the day on the front foot establishing resistance at 72.25, before sellers stepped in and after reversing earlier gains went on to setting support at 70.36. Note that the activity is within the familiar $70 - $72 range. Technically the trend remains up although the overall picture has a downward bias. Geopolitical conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, coupled with supply concerns are being weighed against global economic concerns, tariffs and trade wars. With so many fundamental influences to consider, perhaps technical indicators offer the most reliable information.

### BITCOIN

For the 7th consecutive trading day, price activity remains confined within a relatively narrow $3K+ trading range between $81K and $84K. While the EMAs signal an uptrend, price action has been contained below the descending trendline. While buyers and sellers exchange blows with neither side establishing a meaningful trend in either direction, range traders are seeing the sideways trend - buying off support areas and selling off resistance areas - as a workable strategy.
