### USD INDEX

Sellers won out for the 5th time in the past 6 weeks. Although the charts reflect a series of lower highs, technically (EMAs) the uptrend still remains intact. With recent data re. jobs numbers and inflation (CPI and PPI) underperforming, coupled with an overall negative bias towards the dollar, there is an air of resilience surrounding the world's reserve currency. Note the strong floor which buyers have protected since mid June. Resistance at 97.74 with support at 96.80.

### S&P 500

Buyers were in complete control setting record highs in the equity index as demand for US equities were unquestioned. Similarly we saw record highs in the DJ and NASDAQ. Overbought technicals and profit taking have not yet encouraged sellers to step in. Support sits at 6484 with resistance at 6660.

### GOLD

For the 4th consecutive week the metal moved higher with buyers going onto set record highs in the safe-haven commodity. Noteworthy that equities and gold are both moving in the same direction. Global geopolitical conflicts showing no signs of relief, and a weak USD have both contributed to the current move higher. Add to the picture a lack of prior resistance levels as gold trades in unchartered territory further add to the one-way traffic. Notwithstanding the uptrend, we have seen a slight retracement, or at least a breather, on the daily charts. Support at $3579 with resistance at $3673.

### BRENT OIL

Although buyers won out over the week, technically the chart was full of contradictions with neither buyers nor sellers able to signal a definitive trend in either direction.  Technically the bias looks to be tilted downward with a series of lower highs since mid June 2025. Resistance at $68.21 with support at $65.74.

### BITCOIN

A strong week for the cryptocurrency saw buyers take out significant resistance levels as it broke out of the daily sideways activity. Higher highs and higher lows on the chart add to the double-bottom pattern (reversal) formed at the start of the month (Sept 1 2025). Support at $110.6K with resistance established at $116.9K - a significant level on the daily chart where $117K is the previous resistance level.
