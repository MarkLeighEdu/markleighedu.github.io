### S&P 500

Sellers won out on the day, with a gentle push lower which erased yesterday's gains. Notwithstanding the red candlestick, the chart confirms a 3rd consecutive higher high and higher low on the chart.

### GOLD

A relatively narrow $100 range saw sellers doing enough to secure a lower close and red daily candlestick. Aside from the small loss on the day, a higher low on the daily chart (although slight) may tilt the bias slightly to the upside. Buyers continue to aim at the $5100 mark on the upside, while sellers look to maintain below the $5000 level. Resistance at $5081 with support at $4981.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers did just enough to recoup a slight gap lower at the open, doing enough to secure a green daily candlestick, ending the day alongside yesterday's close. The overall trend remains up since the start of the year with a series of higher lows following dips/retracements up to this point. Resistance at $69.26 with support at $68.44.

### BITCOIN

Sideways activity within a narrow $2.5 - $3K range continued for the 4th consecutive day. Sellers won out for the day, continuing to add to an overall bearish feel.
