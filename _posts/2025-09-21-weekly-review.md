### USD INDEX

Following the Fed's rate cut (25 bps) this week, aside from an immediate knee jerk drop, USD buyers stepped in with a positive response and went on to put in a 3-day rally to close the week. The weekly charts tell an interesting story: EMAs remain up, although within a sideways range; the candlestick is bullish with a long wick signalling the upward reversal; note the descending trendline containing the activity, as well as the multi year low which was established. What is clear: the demand for the worlds reserve currency since the Fed announcement. Support at 95.75 with resistance at 97.40.

### S&P 500

The demand for US equities continues as buyers welcomed the Fed's bearish cut (25 bps) and went on to set record highs in the major US stock markets. To date the overbought technicals have given buyers no reason to let-up. Also, expected bouts of profit taking have not yet materialized as sellers continue to stand on the sidelines. Support at 6605 with resistance at 6731. Whispers of the S&P reaching 7000 by year end has added to the positive sentiment.

### GOLD

The sell-off following the Fed cut appears to have been a strong round of profit-taking and a natural reaction to the USD rally (inverse relationship). However, order was restored on Friday (Sept 19) as buyers confirmed demand for the safe-haven commodity. The 5th consecutive week of higher highs and higher lows with yet another record high being set early in the week. Support at $3624 with resistance at $3705. The lack of previous resistance levels continues to make for sharp rallies when record highs levels get broken and buyers trade in unchartered territory.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers won out on the week with technicals continuing to favour the downside. EMA s down as well as the descending triangle formation containing attempts from buyers. Practically price action continues to trade within a relatively narrow sideways range between $66 and $68 with neither buyers or sellers able to extend beyond these levels. Support at $65.84 with $68.65.

### BITCOIN

Buyers tried higher and sellers tried lower, only for the weekly close to end just where it started with a doji-like candlestick confirming the indecision and lack of direction. The downtrend remains in place, notwithstanding a 3rd consecutive higher high and higher low on the charts which does add to the upward bias and positive sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. Support at $114.3K with resistance at $118K.
