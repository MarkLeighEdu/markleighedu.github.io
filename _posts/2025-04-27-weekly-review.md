### USD INDEX

The U$ had a strong bounce up last week after support was set at 97.67. Although the recovery did enough to be displayed as a green candlestick, the candle completes the 4th consecutive lower high and lower low on the charts. Resistance sits at 99.78 which matches the low form September 2024. Buyers will be aiming to test the 100 level. Negativity surrounds the USD as the index weakens, treasury yields confirm lack of confidence in the future US economy and we see the major US currency pairs all strengthening against the global reserve currency. Technical and fundamental indicators both adding to the strong downtrend.

### S&P 500

In a volatile trading week across the major US stock markets, the S&P had a winning week establishing an impressive close at 5566. Support stands at 5127 which matches the support from August 2024. The market welcomed the possibility of the US China tariff stand-off showing signs of a potential easing for now, as well as Trump (seemingly) backing off his verbal attack on Fed chairman Powell. A turnaround on either of these fronts could see the market panic and react accordingly. Noteworthy that the USD and equity markets both moved higher as opposed to the traditional inverse relationship between the 2 major indices. Also note the double bottom - a strong reversal sign - at the 4824 support from earlier this month.

### GOLD

While the weekly candle is red, confirming that gold closed the week lower than the open, the overall picture tells another story. A new record high set at $3502 and another higher high and higher low add to the year long uptrend. Support sits at $3253. While the USD and US equity markets trade nervously in uncertain market conditions, the safe have commodity maintains its status as buyers step in at every level. As the market takes its natural retracement breathers, coupled with bouts of profit taking, the demand remains unwavering. Technically the fact that trading activity continues to move higher in new unchartered territory doesn't allow for previous levels to act as take profit or stop loss levels which has resulted in sharp moves and wider ranges.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers were not able to add to the previous 2 week's bounce up as buyers and sellers traded punches and continued to trade within a sideways trend. Clearly price action is trading a leg lower since the huge sell-off at the end of March. Support sits at $64.25 with resistance established at $67.66. Buyers have been unable to maintain above $67 for the past 3 weeks although the 3rd consecutive weekly higher low, raising the floor gradually, does tilt the bias upward. Buyers will aim for the relevant and pivotal $70 level, while sellers look below $64.

### BITCOIN

A strong week for the crypto environment saw BTC break out of the mid $80K range and go onto establish resistance at $96K. Support sits at $84.8K. Buyers will be looking up to the psychological $100K mark while sellers first goal will be to test below the $90K level. While the technical levels favour the upside with the EMAs confirming a crossover upward for the first time in 2025, positive sentiment and a hint of "safe status talk" add to the bid tone for the cryptocurrency.  Note the $74.2 support matches the March 2024 resistance.
