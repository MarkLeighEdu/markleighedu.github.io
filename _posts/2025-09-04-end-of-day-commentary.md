### USD INDEX

A familiar pattern saw an early rally fade late in the US session as sellers stepped in and erased roughly half of the early gains. The bias remains down, notwithstanding a green candlestick, with 3 consecutive lower highs on the chart. While the trend is technically down (EMAs), price action shows continued sideways activity hovering close to support levels. Resistance at 97.99 with support at 97.65. Note the formation of a descending triangle adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the world's reserve currency.

### S&P 500

Demand for US equities across the board as buyers put in a strong run to close above 6500, matching the record high area from last week. Note the inverse relationship between weak USD and strong equities. Technically the candlesticks confirm the positive sentiment with the series of higher lows on the charts. Resistance at 6513 with support lower at 6453. Tomorrows NFP expected to have a marked effect leading up to the Wall street open.

### GOLD

Profit taking, overbought technicals, and a brief USD rally saw the metal sold off early in the Asian session. Order was restored when the European session got underway and buyers stepped in confirming demand for the safe haven commodity. The reversal coincided with the USD sell-off - inverse relationship playing out. Support set at $3511 with resistance established at $3545. While buyers aim to set new record highs, sellers aim below $3500 as a first goal to initiate a realistic reversal.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers added to yesterday's sell-off doing just enough to signal a retracement on the daily chart. Resistance sits at $67.39 with support established at $66.28. Buyers did step in and recouped roughly half of the initial losses. Note the similarities from late June 2025 where buyers guarded the same support area. For now it appears that technicals are driving prices.

### BITCOIN

Sellers won out today putting an end to the 3-day mini rally from early this week. Buyers did step in during the afternoon US session and bounced up off the $109K area. Resistance at $112.2K with support established at $109.2K. The trend remains up (EMAs crossed upwards). Buyers continue to aim above $112K while sellers aim to maintain below $110K on the way to reversing the trend.
