<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The uptrend took a pause with neither buyers or sellers dominating the price action. Resistance remains at 104.14 and in so doing forms a double top on the dailies. Sellers will note the reversal formation and aim to retest support at 103.59. The trend and bias are up.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Buyers added to yesterdays gains, formed a higher high and higher low on the charts, and confirmed the inverse relationship between the USDX and S&P in todays price action. Resistance sits at 5837 with support at 5801. While the trend remains up, the bias was relatively flat for most of the US session with neither buyers or sellers taking control.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The 3 day selloff was halted today as sellers were unable to break below the $3000 area. It appears that the year long uptrend and record- breaking rally has taken a natural retracement, a breather, rather than the demand for gold being reversed. Buyers will aim above the $3034 resistance as sellers look reluctant to hang in below the $3K support.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> It was slight, yet the candle is green, a higher high and higher low on the daily charts and the uptrend continues. Buyers maintain control and will look to break above the $72.98 resistance while sellers look below $72 on the way to retest support at $71.88.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> A relatively quiet day as price action was contained between $86.2 and $88.6 in today's activity. The trading range is clearly a leg higher as prices remain above $85K which is looking like a pivotal level. Buyers will be aiming for $90K while sellers aim below at the pivotal mark. The uptrend continues and the bias appears to favour the upside since the lower high of $87.5 is no longer intact.
