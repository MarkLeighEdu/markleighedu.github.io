<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The USD made a strong fight back today and went on to take out recent highs, thereby breaking a series of lower highs on the way to reviving the uptrend on the dailies. Buyers will aim to add to the trend, and tilt the bias upward, thereby creating further demand. While negative sentiment continues to the surround the dollar, a convincing reversal will add as a reminder that the USD remains the global reserve currency. Support at 96.85 with resistance at 97.55. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> The double-top candlestick formation (reversal) played out as sellers added to yesterday's bounce down. Today's move was enough to signal a new downtrend as the EMAs crossed down. The strong rally on the part of the USD contributed to the move lower as the inverse relationship played out. Resistance at 6728 with support lower at 6676.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Just as the equity markets sold-off against a strong USD, so we saw the inverse relationship carried through to gold moving lower/ in the opposite direction to the USD rally. The retracement gained momentum as profit taking entered the picture. While sentiment, technicals and bias all confirm demand for the safe haven commodity, a deeper correction is to be expected as buyers look up at the $4000 mark. Resistance sits at $3778 with support established at $3718. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> A 2nd consecutive strong day saw buyers add to yesterday's bounce and in so doing confirm a new uptrend with EMAs crossing to the upside. Notwithstanding the push higher, price activity remains within a loosely formed sideways range between $66 and $68. Support at $66.80 with resistance at $68.51. Note the current resistance area has contained buyers over the past 2 months.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Buyers put in a strong bounce today halting the 5-day downtrend which started September 19 2025. While the daily downtrend remains intact, EMAs did cross to the upside on the shorter 4H timeframe. Noteworthy that buyers maintained above the relevant $112K level. Support at $111K with resistance established at $113.9K.
