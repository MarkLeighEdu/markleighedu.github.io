### USD INDEX

Following a tight trading range to start the week, sellers took control of the activity and went on to establish support at 103.33 with resistance remaining at 104. Sentiment and bias tilt to the downside as buyers of USD stand on the sidelines. Note the White House tariff statement later today which will no doubt have a marked effect on the USD.

### S&P 500

Equity markets moved in the opposite direction of the USDX with the S&P extending gains for the 3rd consecutive day with higher highs and higher lows confirming a new uptrend with EMAs crossing up. Buyers will aim above 5738 resistance while sellers will look below today's open price of 5673 as the first target on the downside on the way to retesting support at 5615. Although the markets will be closed before Trump's tariff announcement, the equity markets will no doubt react in after hour trading (futures) and be prepared for gaps at the open tomorrow.

### GOLD

Buyers stood strong at $3109 support and gently climbed back to the comfortable $3120 area. The trend and bias are maintained within the uptrend as buyers look up at the $3149 resistance. As long as profit taking doesn't enter the picture, fundamentals and technicals favour the safe haven commodity making further gains. The metal will take its cue from the USD and equity markets response to the White House's tariff announcements later today.

### BRENT OIL

Price action remained close to the resistance area as buyers maintained above $75. Resistance sits at $75.13 with support at $73.84. The oil market will react to the upcoming tariff announcements and seemed to tread water today waiting for the news.

### BITCOIN

Buyers maintained the upper hand extending gains to establish resistance at $87.3K. Support sits at $83.9. Note that buyers did break the descending trendline however the move higher looked nervy. As is the case with all the major instruments, traders are watching for the markets response to the new tariff measures being announce after the markets close today.
