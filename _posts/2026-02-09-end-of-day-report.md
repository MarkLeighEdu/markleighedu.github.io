<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> USD weakness across the board with little demand for the world's reserve currency. The index was sold off sharply, wiping out the majority of last week's gains. Note the turnaround coincided with the 61.8% fib retracement level measuring the January 2026 decline from 99.28 down to 95.36. Resistance at 97.54 with support at 96.65.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> US stock markets held their own with the index gaining 0.47% on the day. Technically, Friday's bullish engulfing candlestick was confirmed as today's push higher was just enough to signal a crossover on the daily EMAs. Price activity remains comfortably above the ascending trendline. Resistance at 7000 with support at 6922. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> While current prices remain a fair way off the record highs set on January 29th 2026 ($5595), buyers added to Friday's fight back with a higher high and higher low on the chart. The sharp $1200 sell-off can be attributed to profit-taking as well as overbought technicals, as demand for the safe haven commodity looks to be keeping buyers in the driver's seat, for now. Next upside target sits at the $5100 mark. Resistance at $5084 with support at $4965. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Buyers added to Friday's gains and in so doing reflect a continuation of the series of higher lows which have been in place since the start of the year. Current resistance level has held strong since August 2025 with buyers not yet able to clear the $70.00 mark with any conviction. The current uptrend appears to be based on anticipated supply concerns, with potential risks enough to fuel the demand for buyers at this point. Resistance at $69.45 with support at $67.14. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Today's limited activity within a tight range ($3.3K), together with a 4th consecutive close hovering around the now pivotal looking $70K level, all contributing to today's doji-like candlestick. Neither buyers or sellers able to add to intraday moves. Buyers would welcome a boost from fundamental factors to create crypto demand, while sellers may be looking at a new leg down following this sideways/rest period. Resistance at $71.5K with support at $68.2K.
