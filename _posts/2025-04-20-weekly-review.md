### USD INDEX

The USD sell-off continued with the index again closing lower and negative USD sentiment showing no signs of a turnaround, either technically or fundamentally. The reality of the U$ losing its status as the world's safe haven status in terms of financial security, US treasury loans coming into question and Trump's 3-month term causing political and social unrest all adding to the global currency's decline. Support sits at 98.89 with an RSI reading at 29. Buyers aiming at a reversal will see the 100 mark as the first upside target.

### S&P 500

Sellers won out in a relatively subdued trading week in the S&P. 5200 was confirmed as a strong support level. Resistance sits at 5500. There were no new startling tariff updates, or perhaps the shock has been absorbed. Fundamentally the Trump Powell tiff could be the next market mover and could potentially add panic to an already nervous market. Noteworthy that the index moved in the same direction as the USDX - not the traditional inverse relationship between the two.

### GOLD

Gold continued its relentless march higher with a new record resistance now sitting at $3356. As the safe haven commodity trades in unchartered territory, without previous levels to work with, buyers continue to buy in at all levels. To date retracements have been short lived and rather than sellers adding to any pull backs, rather buyers see these moves as new buying opportunities on the shorter time frames. Support sits at $3187 with the $3000 level looking pivotal in the big picture.

### BRENT OIL

Oil continued to show demand as buyers added to last week's sharp bounce. Resistance is at $66.69 with buyers getting closer to the pivotal $70 mark. Now that the daily charts have confirmed an uptrend with the EMAs having turned up, the weekly RSI at a lowly 37, there is still plenty of room on the upside from a technical perspective. Should geopolitical concerns bring supply issues to the fore, buyers may find reason to continue the uptrend.

### BITCOIN

The cryptocurrency had an uneventful week as reflected in a narrow trading range between $83K and $86.2K. While the trend remains down, buyers and sellers have kept price action hovering close to the descending trendline which has been in place since the start of the year. The RSI reading at 49 confirms the indecisiveness. Noteworthy that the $74.4K support from the previous week matches the resistance from March 2024. From a fundamental perspective we also note that the lack of investment during the current economic uncertainty brings the crypto's safe-haven status into question.
