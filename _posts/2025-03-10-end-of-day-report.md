<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> In a day of limited activity on the index buyers did prevail without really changing the big picture. The trend remains down and USD sentiment confirms the lack of demand for the global reserve currency. While todays activity reflects a green candlestick the daily high at 103.68 is a lower high on the charts. Sellers will aim below the 103 level.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> A significant selloff saw the major equity move significantly lower throughout the day. Buyers stood on the sidelines as sellers broke below 5800 and 5700 on the way to establishing support at 5618. It wasn't that long ago when the 6000 level looked pivotal. Right now buyers will look up to 5700 as the first target on the upside.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Lack of buyers and demand above $2900 saw sellers dominate price activity on the way to setting support at $2880. Today was the 3rd consecutive red daily candlestick. While sellers will look to add to the technical downtrend, buyers will look for a USD selloff to highlight the metals safe haven status. $2900 is the first upside target while sellers look down at Feb 28 low of $2832.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Sellers were once again dominant as the strong downtrend continues. The support at $69.14 is a record low close for the year with $69.05 clearly in view. The brief fightback on Friday set resistance at $71.36 which sellers may well now see as a lower high on the daily charts.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Todays low of $77363 set a yearly low for the cryptocurrency. The downtrend appears to have gained momentum over the past 5 trading days. With no clear previous levels to set relevant entries, stops and take profits, there could be more downside to follow. Noteworthy is the big move in weekend activity, just as we saw last Sunday - an aspect of the crypto market being open 24/7. Breaking above $80K is the first upside target.
