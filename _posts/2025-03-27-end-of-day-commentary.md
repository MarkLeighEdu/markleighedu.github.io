Following a gap down in pre-market trading, buyers and sellers traded punches to end the day back where it started - the indecision confirmed by the doji like daily candlestick.

### GOLD

After a brief pause and gentle retracement, 3 consecutive days of higher lows, and getting held up at $3030 resistance area, buyers stormed back confirming the demand for the safe haven commodity and in so doing established a record high at $3059. Support sits at $3023 with the $3000 mark looking like the pivotal level.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers tested support at $72.40 early, before buyers stepped in and retested the $73.40 resistance area. Note the resistance matches the first fib retracement level (38.2%) from the preceding downtrend. The uptrend remains intact with buyers looking up to $74. Fundamentals are lined up with technicals as both supply concerns and geopolitical tensions both appear to be fragile. Tariffs, trade wars and global economic uncertainty all appear to be adding to the upward bias.

### BITCOIN

Another relatively quiet day for the cryptocurrency as price action was contained within a relatively narrow range between $85.7K and $87.4K. While technicals are not signalling or favouring a break in either direction, it seems fundamental news from the White House could be the catalyst for the next meaningful move. The trend remains up on the daily charts with an RSI reading of 52.
