### USD INDEX

It was an extremely volatile day in the markets as the USDX broke below significant support levels establishing a new yearly low at 102.76. The downtrend is confirmed on all fronts, technically, fundamentally and perhaps most importantly, the negative sentiment surrounding the USD. Sellers will be aiming at 102 while buyers aim to retake 103 as a first target on the upside.

### S&P 500

It was all about tariffs - on again off again - and the threat of trade wars influencing the major US equity markets. After buyers set an intraday high at 5702, sellers won the day with a strong selloff to set support at 5581.Notwworthy that again we see USDX and S&P moving in the same direction, in this case both moving lower, as opposed to the traditional inverse relationship between the 2 major indices. While the trend remains relatively within a range, recession rhetoric and new low projections could turn the mood into one of panic selling where buyers will remain on the sidelines.

### GOLD

Buyers were in control throughout the day which saw the metal gain a solid $40 from support at $2880 to establish resistance at $2922. Demand for golds safe haven status in the face of global geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with the traditional inverse relationship between gold and the USD could bring the $2954 record high back into focus. Sellers will aim below the pivotal $2900 level.

### BRENT OIL

After a brief test of the $68.62 support level, buyers stepped in to recoup a portion of yesterdays losses and push higher to establish resistance at $70.41. Buyers could not hold onto the gains and settled for a close slightly below the relevant $70 mark. While recent price action has been contained within a loosely formed $2 range between $68.36 and $71.20, it is noteworthy that the activity is clearly a leg lower than we have seen since late last year.

### BITCOIN

A strong rally for the cryptocurrency saw bitcoin close above $83K from a daily low of $76.4K. While the trend remains down buyers will aim to maintain the upward bias and look up to $90K in an attempt to reversing the downtrend. Sellers will aim below $80K to retest the $76K support area.
