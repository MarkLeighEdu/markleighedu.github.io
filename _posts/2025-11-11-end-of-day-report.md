<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Sellers controlled price action with a solid push lower and adding to the downtrend. The low of the day matches the resistance area from last month (October 2025). The bias and sentiment favour the downside with a negative feel to the USD. Political uncertainty surrounding the White House shutdown appears to be adding to the selling mood. Resistance at 99.64 with support at 99.12.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Buyers recouped early losses and went on to record a higher high and higher low on the chart. While the demand was enough to complete a green candlestick on the day, the index needs a further push higher to fully reverse the preceding downtrend. Resistance at 6876 with support at 6829. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Buyers did enough to record a higher high and add to the newly formed uptrend. Today is the highest close since the steep sell-off from October 21st which initiated the preceding downtrend which saw the metal lose $500. Note buyers first broke above the pivotal $4000 mark and have now broken and maintained above $4100, clearly adding to the reversal/bullish sentiment surrounding the safe haven commodity. Also, we are seeing the inverse relationship between weak USD and strong gold playing out. Resistance at $4148 with support at $4095.   

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Oil broke out of the recent sideways range with buyers taking control, bouncing up off the strong support area, and establishing a clear uptrend on the charts. The current resistance level has been guarded successfully by sellers, as buyers once again aim to retest the $65 level. Resistance at $65.28 with support at $63.60. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Sellers made a strong statement with a steep sell-off in response to a brief push higher to start the session. This pattern has a familiar look for the past month as sellers reverse attempted rallies - note the descending trendline with lower highs since early October 2025. Next downside target will be a retest of the $100K mark, as buyers look to break above the trendline. Resistance at $107.5 with support at $102.5K.
