### USD INDEX

The USD felt the brunt of the Trump tariff news and was sold off immediately following the announcement. All factors combined to see the USDX set a new yearly low of 100.98 as negative sentiment saw sellers react sharply to the fundamental and technical downturn. Friday did see buyers step in following strong job numbers and went onto establish resistance at 102.62. A positive for the USD is the traditional inverse relationship between USD and equity markets. Note the strength of the 101 support area since 2023.

### S&P 500

All the major US indices sold off sharply following the tariff announcement last week and the S&P closed at 5100 support at the Friday close, the same level as the August 2024 low.  In pre market trading the support sits at 4842. Note the support level matches the highs from December 2023 and further back to January 2022. Market uncertainty continues to add to the selloff with reciprocal tariffs and recession talk giving buyers little reason to step in.

### GOLD

Gold's record setting bull run has been reversed, well technically at least. Note the bearish engulfing candlestick formation - a strong bearish signal. Following the all market selloff resulting from the tariff announcements, sellers brought the metal down from its all time high at $3167, down to $2977 to close the week. Significantly the $3000 mark offered little resistance and that same level now looks to be the first target on the upside. Buyers may see current levels as a buying opportunity as golds safe haven status remains amid an unsettled and nervous financial environment. Sellers will eye the $2800 area on the downside.

### BRENT OIL

Unsurprisingly oil was another commodity that was reversed as sellers reacted to the start of the new trade wars set in motion last week. From a weekly high at $75.47, the tariff announcements saw a weekly support of $64.26 to close the week matching support levels not seen since 2021. A global slowdown, probability of a recession gaining momentum, and supply concerns attached to geopolitical conflicts are all adding to the sharp price decline.

### BITCOIN

After a brief move higher and another failed attempt to maintain above $88K, sellers dominated the weeks trading and significantly, closed below $80K with support at $76.8K. Since peaking at $110K in January 2025, the cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend for much of Q1 with buyers unable to reverse the strong downtrend. With price action at current levels, the $85K mark continues to look pivotal. Its noteworthy that bitcoin was not seen as a safe investment alternative through last weeks market turmoil created by the White House's new tariff plans. The downward bias is in spite of Trumps personal crypto businesses.
