### USD INDEX

The USD made a strong fight back today and went on to take out recent highs, thereby breaking a series of lower highs on the way to reviving the uptrend on the dailies. Buyers will aim to add to the trend, and tilt the bias upward, thereby creating further demand. While negative sentiment continues to the surround the dollar, a convincing reversal will add as a reminder that the USD remains the global reserve currency. Support at 96.85 with resistance at 97.55.
