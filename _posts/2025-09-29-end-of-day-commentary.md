### GOLD

The metal started the week on the front foot and went on to set a new record high with buyers firmly in control. Sellers remain on the sidelines, demand is unwavering, and no previous resistance levels are all contributing to the one-way rally. Overbought technicals have not had an impact on the rally and it appears that traders are not yet ready to consider profit-taking with the $4000 level clearly in focus. Support at $3764 with resistance at $3833.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers took control from the outset and never gave up on the strong sell-off, doing enough to reverse the trend and establish a new downtrend. Resistance at $68.99 with support established at $66.66. Note the strong resistance level at $69 was again fiercely protected by sellers.

### BITCOIN

A strong 2- day rally has seen the cryptocurrency gain $5K ($109.5K - $114.5k) and in so doing establish a new uptrend with the EMAs crossing to the upside.

Support at $111.5K with resistance at $114.5K.
