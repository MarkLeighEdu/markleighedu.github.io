<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The USD lost ground today, added to the downtrend, yet it did show relative stability following last week's drastic sell-off. Buyers were unable to trade above 100 while sellers set support at 98.96, marginally higher than the 98.78 low. RSI remains oversold reading 26. Without a material move lower, sentiment remains negative as the market digests the thought of the global reserve currency coming into question. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> After gapping up to start the week, the day ended slightly lower than the open with buyers unable to add to the pre-market gains. Resistance sits at 5498 with support at 5386. The stock markets held their own and last week's late rally and technical uptrend remain intact. Buyers will aim for pre reciprocal levels (5500 - 5600) on a slow but steady basis, knowing that new a single statement, true or a rumour, can trigger panic selling at any point.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The metal took a long-awaited breather from its record rally with profit taking and overbought technical indicators contributing. The $3245 resistance now forms a double top (strong reversal signal) which may provide sellers with a reason to follow up on today's retracement. Sellers will look below today's $3193 support level. Buyers recognize that the commodity is still the standout safe haven financial instrument and may see the pull back and lower price as a new buying opportunity.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Oil ended the day alongside the open as the price action was contained within a narrow range between $63.83 and $65.76. The chart confirms a higher high and higher low. Buyers will look to regain $66 while sellers will aim below $63. As long as supply concerns remain a non issue and a global economic slowdown continues to look probable, the bias could remain tilted to the downside. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> A tight trading range saw buyers and sellers not willing to make a stand in either direction. Resistance sits at $85.7K with support at $83.6K. The EMAs signal an uptrend while sellers are battling to keep price action below the descending trendline. Buyers look up to the high $80K area while sellers aim below the $80K level.
