### USD INDEX

The USD bounced back today closing above yesterdays open and setting resistance at 98.73. Todays rally could well be a response to the overbought RSI reading which went from 26 to 30, rather than a change in sentiment towards the USD. Next target on the upside will be last weeks close and a break above the 99 level, while sellers will look to resume the daily downtrend and aim below 98.

### S&P 500

In keeping with the USD mini rally, equity markets bounce back today with S&P closing above yesterdays open and in so doing produced a higher high and higher low on the daily charts, doing enough to reinstate an uptrend with EMAs again crossing upwards. Resistance sits at 5317 with support at 5165. The close price of 5317 matches the close price from last week. While buyers aim for 5500 on the upside, sellers will be looking down to the 5100 support area.

### GOLD

The inverse relationship between gold and the USD played out today as the metal took a well earned break and retraced from yet another record breaking high earlier in the session. Resistance sits at $3502 with daily support set at $3364. Noteworthy that the RSI continues to signal overbought conditions with a reading of 71. Todays sell-off may trigger additional profit taking should the USDX maintain todays move higher. The natural pause reflects a technical move rather than a change in the commodities safe haven status. As long as the $3300 area holds as a floor, technically the uptrend remains intact.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers won out in a quiet day in the oil market as price activity was contained within a narrow trading range between $65.62 and $67.16. The gentle move up was enough to maintain the uptrend, although sideways would be a more accurate description as the uptrend has stalled following the bullish engulfing bounce up on April 9.

### BITCOIN

Finally the break which had been brewing over the past 10 days. Following yesterdays strong push higher, buyers convincingly broke above the $88K mark and went onto establish resistance at $91.8K. With support at $86.8 that's a $5K daily move and puts buyers firmly in the drivers seat. The uptrend is confirmed with the EMA leading indicator pulling away sharply, and an RSI reading of 64 leaving room on the upside for further gains. Noteworthy that bitcoin moved in tandem with the USD as gold was sold off in todays action. Also note that the current resistance area has been a strong support area from late last year and early 2025.
