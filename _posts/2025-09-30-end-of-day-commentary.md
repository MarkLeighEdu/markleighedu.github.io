### USD INDEX

A repeat of yesterday's price action saw sellers win out on the day with a strong sell-off to start the day, followed by buyers fighting back through the late US session, recouping half of the day's losses. However, the uptrend remains intact, notwithstanding the 3rd consecutive day of lower highs and lower lows on the chart. Resistance at 97.71 with support lower at 97.32.

### S&P 500

Following a mild sell-off to start, buyers stepped in late in the day confirming the demand for the index. The demand for US equities was across the board. Support at 6694 with resistance at 6743. Buyers will aim to test the record high 6756 (September 22 2025) while sellers aim below the 6700 level. Note the inverse relationship between weak USD and strong equities.

### GOLD

Another day, a new record high for the metal. Following another brief bout of profit taking, buyers stepped in confirming demand for the safe haven commodity. The fundamentals, technicals and sentiment remain the same - all in favour of gold enjoying an unprecedented rally with sellers - profit takers - giving in at the first sight of buyers entering the picture. Support at $3790 with resistance established at $3870.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers picked up from yesterday and added to the downtrend. Resistance at $66.85 with support at $65.67. Note the strong floor/support area which buyers have protected since June 2025. As long as the current support holds, price action continues to move within a broad sideways range between $65.50 and $68.50.

### BITCOIN

A resilient showing as buyers put in a rally during the late US session to recoup earlier losses and end the day back where it started, alongside yesterday's close. The higher high and higher low added to the uptrend. However, the doji-like candlestick does confirm indecision and a lack of direction from both sides. Next hurdle on the upside will be a test of the descending trendline, which started at the high from August 14th 2025 ($124K). Sellers will aim below $112K in an attempt to reverse the trend. Support sits at $112.6K with resistance at $114.8K.
