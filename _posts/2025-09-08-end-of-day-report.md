<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The USD started the week being beaten up on all fronts. Sellers controlled the index pushing lower adding to the established downtrend. Potential rate cuts plus overall negative USD sentiment contributed to the sell-off. Resistance at 97.55 with support established at 96.98. Note support matches the July 23 lows, where buyers stepped in and reversed the trend. While history is always relevant for technical traders, circumstances do seem very different from only 2 months ago. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Buyers won out today, although the range was narrow with neither buyers or sellers making a significant move. Resistance at 6515 with support lower at 6480. Sellers did not add to Friday's sell-off and although demand was limited, it was enough to maintain the upward trend and bias. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> A new day, same story - the metal continues to set record highs as buyers add to the uptrend with higher highs and higher lows. 10 green candles out of the last 11 days. Since testing $3300 support (August 19 2025) gold has gained $347. Support at $3510 with resistance at $3647. Gold dominates against the USD, equity markets, or any other asset classes which may have attempted to challenge the safe haven commodity. Clearly BTC has not been successful in it's quest to replace XAU for that title in these uncertain times. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Oil showed resilience today as buyers stepped in to halt the 3 day sell-off late last week. Buyers put in an early rally but were unable to maintain as sellers stepped in and erased much of the early gains. Resistance at $67.02 with support a5 $65.77. The current support area held last month (August 2025) and looks to face selling pressure again. Trend and bias both point downward. Buyers will aim above $67 in an attempt to reverse the trend, while sellers look below the well guarded $65 level.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Price action was contained within a familiar $2.5K range with buyers doing enough to add to the uptrend with a higher high and higher low on the chart. Support at $110.5K with resistance higher at $113K. The daily close rests in the $112K comfort area. Neither buyers or sellers have managed to maintain outside of the current range. Although the EMAs do signal an uptrend, the recent $113.3K high (September 5th) does show as a lower high within the overall downtrend.
