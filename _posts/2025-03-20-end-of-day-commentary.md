### USD INDEX

Buyers controlled todays activity with a solid move higher and matched the 103.77 resistance level before sellers stepped in to close at 103.44. The trend is up and the bias is positive with a 3rd consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows. Support at 103 has held strong.

### S&P 500

A volatile day on the equity index closed with sellers winning out to close lower at 5713. Resistance sits at 5764 with support at 5679. Notwithstanding the red colour, the daily candlestick does show a higher low with the EMAs pointing up and the bias also favours the upside. However to add to the uncertain conditions, RSI is under 50, measuring 42.

### GOLD

Aside from the red daily candle, all else remains positive as the metal closed alongside yesterdays close at $3044. A new record high saw resistance established at $3057. Intraday support at $3023 held strong after a brief retracement early in the day. While demand prevails at all levels, buyers continue to step in given the opportunity. It appears the metal holds its own when the USD strengthens and makes its stronger moves up when the dollar softens.

### BRENT OIL

A strong day for oil as geopolitical issues along with supply concerns created demand. Buyers stepped in at the $70 support area and went onto set resistance at $71.70. Buyers will eye $72 as the next upside target while sellers look below to regain the pivotal $70 mark.

### BITCOIN

Following yesterdays strong rally to $87K, sellers took over today and established support at $83.5K. Sellers will look to maintain the $81K to $85k range, while buyers look to establish the range a leg higher between $85K and $90K. As neither buyers or sellers are able to hold on or add to moves in either direction, it would seem that fundamental news is needed for a meaningful trend to be established. Based on the White House's previous crypto rhetoric a positive push higher seems more likely.
