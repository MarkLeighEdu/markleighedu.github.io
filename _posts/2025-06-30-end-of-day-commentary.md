### USD INDEX

Sellers again in control as the index closed lower for the 6th consecutive day. Negative US sentiment continues to weigh on the USD as buyers remain on the sidelines. A slight test higher early in the Asian session was held up by the descending trendline, followed by the formation of a descending triangle which saw sellers break below the base. Support now sits at 96.41 with resistance higher at 96.94. Buyers will aim at the 97 mark in an attempt to reverse the well-established downtrend, with sellers looking to extend the sell-off down to the 96 area.

### S&P 500

The index rallied higher for the 6th consecutive day highlighting the classic inverse relationship between a weak USD and strong equities. The demand is steady as buyers continue to set higher highs, adding to the uptrend. The poor performance of US yields adds to the strong showing across US stock markets. Support rests at 6224 with record setting resistance established at 6265. Technically, note the overbought readings with RSI at 71. Add profit-taking to the equation as traders watch for a possible retracement or limited pull-back on the shorter timeframes. New trade deal announcements could also have an effect on the bull market.

### GOLD

Buyers took charge from the open and maintained demand throughout the day, wiping out the majority of the losses from Friday last week. The $3260 area proves to be a solid support level. Although today's green candlestick confirms the reversal on the shorter time-frames, the daily trend remains down with a lower high adding to the trend. Significantly, resistance was established at $3309, breaking above the pivotal $3300 level. The metals safe haven status remains intact and todays move higher confirmed the inverse relationship between weak USD and strong gold. While buyers look up to $3350, sellers will aim below $3300 as a start to resuming the downtrend.

### BRENT OIL

Oil continued to hover close to the $66 mark with limited activity in either direction. Resistance at $67.15 with support at $65.86. The middle east ceasefire and no news on the trade deal/tariff front both contributing to the lack of supply concerns and hence, the narrow range and lack of new direction continues.

### BITCOIN

A relatively narrow trading range between $108.8K on the upside and $106.6K on the downside as neither buyers or sellers took control. The red candlestick confirms that sellers did win out on the day, although the technical uptrend (EMAs up) could more practically be seen as sideways. Buyers continue to look up to $110K, while sellers aim below $106K.
