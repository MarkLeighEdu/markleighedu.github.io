### USD INDEX

A small gap up to start the day helped buyers to hang on to a slight gain on the way to establishing resistance at 99.18. Sellers were not able to add to yesterday's sell-off with daily support matching yesterdays low at 98.68. While the uptrend remains intact, price action has been moving sideways with a downward bias reflected in a series of lower highs on the chart.

### S&P 500

In a slow but steady manner buyers continue to add to the uptrend with a 5th consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows. Resistance sits at 5597 with support at 5520. The gentle move higher confirms demand winning out over supply as sellers remain on the sidelines. Noteworthy that the equity markets and USD are both moving higher as opposed to the traditional inverse relationship between the two indices.

### GOLD

Sellers continued to add to the downtrend closing below yesterdays open price of $3317. Resistance sits at $3339 with support established at $3298 - a relatively narrow $41 range. The current relationship between gold and the USD appears to be that the metal rallies strong when the U$ weakens, and seems to hold its own when the USD strengthens. The $3300 level continues to be a solid floor for buyers with further technical confirmation of constant demand for the safe haven commodity as seen in the fib retracement tool measured from the $2956 low to the $3502 high showing no daily close below the first fib retracement level (38.2%) at $3291 over the past 5 days.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers continued from yesterdays sell-off with another push lower on the way to setting support at $62.96. Todays move was enough to signal the EMAs cross downwards and closer to the $60 area. Buyers will look up to regain the $64 mark on the way to reversing, or at least stopping the strong selling which started at the beginning of the month when Brent was trading at $75.41.

### BITCOIN

Another uneventful day for the cryptocurrency which traded in a narrow range between $94.2K and $95.4K. The trend moves sideways as neither side has been able to establish a meaningful move for the past 7 days. Buyers step in at the low $90K area while sellers do the same at the mid $95K area. While the technicals have not been able to dictate new market direction, traders look to the White House and fundamental news, positive or negative, to provide indicators of potential new trend direction.
