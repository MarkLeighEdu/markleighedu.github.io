<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> A narrow sideways range within a flattening uptrend. Buyers unable to maintain above 104.05 resistance while sellers established support at 103.66. The succession of lower highs remains in place and an RSI reading of 43 both favour a downward bias. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> After a gap lower to start the day and sellers retesting and creating support at 5600, buyers stepped up and put in a strong run establishing resistance at 5695 and in so doing created a higher high and higher low on the charts. Notwithstanding the 2-day fightback, the bias appears to have a downward tilt as long as 5700 -5750 is not broken to the upside. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> After yet another new record high ($3148) sellers stepped in with a not unexpected retracement - profit taking, USD gains and overbought RSI readings - setting support at $3100. The slightly red doji-like candlestick adds to the succession of higher highs and higher lows on the daily charts. While the daily uptrend remains intact the hourly charts signal a downtrend with a descending trendline containing activity below the $3120 area.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> After buyers broke above yesterdays high and established resistance at $75.30, sellers stepped in and closed below the open, setting support at $74.34. This current level is significant in that the area has acted as resistance late in 2024 and has also served as a support in February 2025. The uptrend still appears to have legs with RSI at 59, talk of supply concerns and last month's standout performance of the energy sector within the equity markets. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> The cryptocurrency had a strong day as buyers took control and broke out of the $82K area and went on to establish resistance at $85.5K. Buyers will aim to maintain above the pivotal $85K level and test and break the descending trendline which has contained a series of lower highs since the start of the year. Sellers will look below $80K to add to the overall downward bias.
