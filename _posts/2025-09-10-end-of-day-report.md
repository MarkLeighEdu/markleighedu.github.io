<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Following an early sell-off buyers stepped in to recoup losses and end the day with a slight gain. The trend remains down, although the chart does reflect a higher high and higher low. Support at 97.16 with resistance at 97.52. The fight back showed resilience on the part of the USD with recent weak data weighing on the global reserve currency. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> A breakout performance from the index saw record highs established. Support at 6528 with resistance set at 6618. While the USD struggles to regain credibility, demand for US equities continues to hold with sellers reluctant to step in. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The metal recouped a portion of yesterday's losses with buyers stepping in and confirming demand for the safe haven commodity. Support set at $3620 with resistance higher at $3657. While the uptrend remains firmly intact, there does appear to be a slight retracement as buyers take a breather. The sideways activity can be seen on the shorter time-frames.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Buyers added to recent turn higher with a strong rally signalling a 3rd consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows on the chart. The push was enough to signal a new uptrend as the EMA's crossed to the upside. Geopolitical tensions and global uncertainty on several fronts added to the move. Support at $66.68 with resistance established at $67.76.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> A breakout day for the cryptocurrency saw a $3K+ rally as buyers took control from the outset. Support at $110.9K with resistance established at $114.1K. The uptrend has gained momentum since bouncing up off the $110K level earlier this month. The next upside target stands at $117 (August 22 2025).
