### USD INDEX

Last week buyers halted the year long downtrend confirmed with a doji like candlestick. This week they went one step further by securing a green candlestick, forming a double bottom (reversal sign) and signalling an uptrend on the daily charts. Notwithstanding the negative sentiment surrounding the USD the bias has turned up going into the last week of the month. Price action was contained between 102.83 support and 103.90 resistance. Although the USD softened following the FEDs policy statement, the worlds reserve currency did show resilience ending the week on the front foot.

### S&P 500

The major US equity markets experienced a particularly volatile week with buyers winning out and a green candlestick ending the strong 4 week red selloff. The bounce up off 5649 support went on to establish resistance at 5769 and in so doing reversed the daily trend with the EMAs crossing up. Noteworthy is that the S&P and USDX both showed a retracement of the downtrends, and show similar technical patterns on the charts rather than the traditional inverse relationship between the 2 indices. The haphazard action in the US major equity markets were mainly influenced by the White House's on-off tariff agenda.

### GOLD

Gold put in another strong week with new record highs ($3058), higher highs and higher lows on the charts, and confirming demand at all levels. Following a retracement and a brief selloff down to $2981, buyers stepped in to secure a close above $3000 and confirm the metals safe haven status in an uneasy economic and geopolitical climate. As price action continues to move higher into uncharted territory, traders look at shorter time frames to identify relevant price points for entry and stoploss levels. Generally sellers are remaining on the sidelines as buyers maintain control.

### BRENT OIL

The $70 support again held strong as buyers added to last weeks gains and in so doing signalled a higher high and higher low on the charts. Although the trend remains down, the retracement has signalled a reversal on the daily charts and the bias is up going into the new week. Resistance sits at $72.25 while support moved up from the previous week to $69.53. Contributing factors remain supply concerns, a global economic slowdown and geopolitical uncertainty as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East continue.

### BITCOIN

A relatively narrow trading range saw the cryptocurrency trade between $81K and $87.5K. While the trend remains down neither buyers or sellers have been able to maintain or add to daily moves in either direction. Note the fib retracement tool measuring the uptrend from $50K up to $110K and see the retracement down has been held up at the 50% retracement level at $79.2K. In order for a meaningful trend to be established sellers aim below $80K while buyers aim above $90K. Perhaps fundamental announcements from the White House relating to the positive recognition of crypto and easing regulation laws may give buyers the push required to revisit the $100K mark.
