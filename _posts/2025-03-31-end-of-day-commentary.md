### USD INDEX

The USD held its own and strengthened slightly on the day. While the daily uptrend remains intact, coupled with today's activity reflected in a green candlestick, the charts confirm a 3rd consecutive day of lower highs and lower lows. RSI reads 42. Buyers established resistance at 104.08, with sellers setting support at 103.40.

### S&P 500

Buyers won out in a day filled with conflicting technical signals. Following a large gap down to start the day's trading, sellers went on to set support at 5535. Buyers stepped in at this point and rallied above Friday's low and went on to establish resistance at 5671. Notwithstanding the fightback, the charts confirm a 4th straight day of lower highs and lower lows. While the market awaits April 2 Liberation Day for clarity on tariffs, rumours and threats continue to trigger the intraday swings. Noteworthy that energy was the standout sector for March.

### GOLD

While the USD and equity markets continue to send mixed signals, the gold chart provides textbook clarity. The uptrend extends as new record highs are established and demand for the metal is unwavering at every new level. Factors affecting the rally include gold's inverse relationship with a weak USD, as well as the commodities safe haven status in an uncertain world both geopolitically and economically. Resistance sits at $3126 with intraday support at $3076. Two factors to be considered are the oversold RSI reading at 77, and signals from the buyers who opt for profit taking at the first sign of a pause or retracement.

### BRENT OIL

After struggling at the $73.50 resistance from last week, buyers confirmed the demand for oil and went on to rally convincingly with daily resistance now sitting at $75.05. The next target on the upside is $76.72. This month- long rally is impressive bearing in mind that the starting point from March 5 was $68.28. Sellers will aim below $74 at a minimum in attempting to reverse the trend. Noteworthy that the stock markets reflect that energy was the standout sector in March.

### BITCOIN

A relatively quiet day for the cryptocurrency as buyers and sellers traded punches, only to end the day back where it started, at $82.6K - right in the middle of the $3K daily range between $81K and $84K. The trend remains down and bias appears tilted to the downside. Note the descending trendline since the start of the year. Interesting that bitcoin continues to trade between $80K and $90K with neither side managing to establish a meaningful trend and set a definitive relationship with the other traditional instruments, namely gold, USD and equity markets.
