### USD INDEX

The USD opened marginally higher to start the day and went on to trade within a narrow range between 98.98 support and 99.51 resistance. The closing price is reflected in a doji-like candlestick confirming the lack of direction. The bias continues to be tilted downwards and the trend remains down. Noteworthy that the support has held strong throughout the week, although there is clearly a lack of demand as negative sentiment weighs on the global reserve currency.

### S&P 500

Buyers had a brief run higher and established resistance at 5375 before sellers stepped in late to close alongside yesterdays close setting support at 5311. The stand-off between buyers and sellers is reflected in a doji-like candlestick. While the chart shows that buyers are hanging on to a weak uptrend, today does show a 4th consecutive day of lower highs, although it is marginal.

### GOLD

A gap up to start the day and then a new record high with resistance at $3357. Sellers then stepped in and drove prices down to establish support at $3283. As has become the norm buyers then took control after the brief retracement and went on to close at $3322. Throughout this historic rally we have seen demand at every level as sellers run out of steam after brief bouts of profit taking and natural pull backs with buyers ready to step in.

### BRENT OIL

Buyers added to yesterdays gains and picked up momentum on the way to establishing resistance at $67.16. Buyers will look up to test the $68 mark on the way to regaining the pivotal $70 level. Technically the uptrend gains momentum as the EMAs track higher.  The RSI reads 44.

### BITCOIN

Buyers took control from the outset and tracked higher throughout the trading day. Price action was restricted to a narrow trading range between $83.7K support and $85.4K resistance. Noteworthy that buyers maintained above the descending trendline, yet were unable to close above the $85K area, which has been the case for the past 6 days. The trend remains up and RSI stands at 53.
