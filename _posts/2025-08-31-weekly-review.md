### USD INDEX

Technically the uptrend remains in place with the leading indicator above the lagging indicator (EMAs), although the activity continues within a sideways range. The week ended with sellers in control with the close price matching the previous week's close. The bias feels to favour the downside with negative sentiment continuing to surround the global currency. Resistance at 98.66 with support at 97.60. Note the weekly close remains confined within the current range for 6 of the past 7 weeks, with the 98 level appearing to be a comfort area for the index.

### S&P 500

The uptrend remains intact with the weekly close matching the previous 2 week's closing price. The S&P set record highs and record close prices confirming the demand for US equities. Note the similarities between the USDX and S&P both matching their respective previous week's close prices. Resistance at 6522 with support set at 6428. Major US equity markets closed Monday September 1 for Labour Day.

### GOLD

Following a sustained period of sideways activity, buyers broke out and went on to set record closes for the metal. With the USD looking vulnerable, the inverse relationship between weak dollar and strong gold was confirmed. Resistance at $3453 with support below at $3351. Further USD weakness could see the record $3500 level being targeted. Note that sellers did step in when last this resistance level was tested (June 16 2025).

### BRENT OIL

While the EMAs reflect the downtrend is still in place, barely, the chart does show a higher high and higher low with the bias tilted slightly to the upside. The close matches last week's close price with an upper and lower wick on the weekly candlestick confirming indecision as neither buyers or sellers have maintained or added to daily moves and therefore unable to establish a significant trend in either direction. Resistance at $68.54 with support at $66.36.

### BITCOIN

Sellers made a strong push lower and added to the 3 week downtrend with lower highs and lower lows on the chart. Current support level acted as resistance area in December 2024 and January 2025. Resistance sits at $113.8K with support established at $107.2K. Should buyers not step in, sellers will look down at the big $100K level.
