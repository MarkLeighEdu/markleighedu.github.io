### USD INDEX

The USD weakened on the day while the 102.51 support did maintain the ascending trendline, as well as adding to a series of lower highs on the daily charts. Buyers failed to maintain above 103, although the bias and trend are tilted to the upside. The inverse relationship between USDX and major equity markets is a positive for now as the stock markets continue to be battered.

### S&P 500

After gapping up in pre market trading, followed by a brief period of buying at the open, tariff uncertainty, inflation fears and a global slowdown were the prevailing factors.  For the 2nd day sellers stepped in late and went onto establish support at 4935. While the charts reflect a higher low, the trend and bias are all down as the market nervously awaits the initial tariff deadline dates, as well as retaliatory dates all coming into effect. Buyers first goal will be to maintain above 5000.

### GOLD

Buyers tested and broke above $3000, but were unable to maintain as sellers controlled the activity and brough the price down from $3022 resistance, to close at $2982. While the trend remains down, the doji like daily candle confirms the uncertainty on both sides. The support at $2956 which matches the February resistance level could be the floor as the commodities safe haven status amid the current financial and geopolitical uncertainty could attracts demand at current levels, ie. below $3000.

### BRENT OIL

With no relevant levels on the downside, sellers found no barriers to halt the selloff and went on to set support at an alarmingly low $61.29. It was only 5 days ago (April 2) that oil was trading at $75.47. The contributing factors remain the fear of a global slowdown, an increasing possibility of a global recession, with little concern of supply issues. From a technical perspective we have to go back to March 2021 to see the current levels act as a support area and a level to perhaps pause the current drastic slide. Note the oversold RSI reading of 23.

### BITCOIN

Sellers continued the move lower and confirm the established downtrend. The daily range was confined to under $4K with resistance at $80.8K and support at $77K. Buyers have been unable to maintain above $80K while sellers will look down at $74.2 support as the next downside target. In current climate conditions, investors have refrained from seeing bitcoin as a safe haven asset and the White House has also failed to boost the cryptocurrency, this is spite of Trump's personal crypto endorsements.
