<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> A gap up to start the day and buyers added to early move higher maintaining throughout the session. Resistance established at 99.60 with the 100 mark now in view. The 2 day rally has been enough to confirm an uptrend with EMAs crossing to the upside. Sellers will target below 99 in order to reestablish the big picture downtrend which has been in place since the start of the year.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> After gapping up at the open, followed by buyers reaching the pivotal 5500 level, sellers stepped in and the index closed marginally higher to end another volatile day back where it started. The daily doji-like candlestick confirms the uncertainty and real lack of direction. While buyers will aim to retest the 5536 level, sellers will look to break below yesterdays close at 5322.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The metal added to yesterdays sell-off with support established at $3258. Technically we had a gap down to start the day and todays price action was enough to signal a downtrend with EMAs crossing to the downside. The 2 day downturn coincides with the U$ 2 day upturn - traditional inverse relationship with the 2 major instruments playing out. Profit taking added to the selling, as did the technical RSI reading which looked overdue for a reversal. With prices now $200 lower than yesterdays $3502 high, buyers may well see this as a buying opportunity as clearly the commodity has not lost its safe haven status.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> After buyers set resistance at $67.66 sellers took over and won the day establishing support at $64.41, before settling at $65.15 to close the day. While the uptrend hangs on, just barely, the trend appears sideways with neither buyers or sellers taking control.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Following 2 days of sustained buying and the uptrend firmly in place, todays action was limited to a narrow $2.8K range with buyers adding slightly to recent gains. Resistance sits at $94.7K with support at $92K. Note todays resistance matches the high from March 2 2025. While buyers have an eye on the $100K mark, sellers will aim below $90K as a first step in reversing, or at least pausing the uptrend.
