<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Another day of extreme USD selling saw support established at 98.92 and the 98.80 set last week looks not only attainable, but probable as dollar sentiment continues to weaken. The questioning of the US's decades long status as global reserve currency, stock market haven and solid treasury market are all adding to the USD sell-off. While all the major currencies make gains against the dollar the index will struggle to bounce off the lows and buyers look to rely on an equity market recovery (inverse relationship) and oversold technical indicators to offer some reprieve.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> It took a late afternoon rally to recoup a portion of the days losses as sellers tested the 5246 support level. Todays move lower may not have been enough to reverse the uptrend, yet the bias is down and there is clearly a lack of demand as buyers look to regain the 5500 resistance area. Noteworthy that equity markets and the USD are moving in tandem, as is the treasury market?all lower. The markets are looking for positive tariff news and it appears that only Trump can provide that much needed lifeline at this point.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> While equities and the USD continue to be sold off amid negative sentiment, so the safe haven status of the metal commodity confirmed that demand continues at every level. As gold makes new record highs and trades in unchartered territory the lack of relevant resistance levels leaves the upside with room to continue this historic rally. Another $90+ gain saw a resistance level of $3342 in place. The inverse relationship with the USD adds to the extreme uptrend. Profit taking and extreme overbought technical readings remain the incentives for a pull back of any substance. Daily support sits at $3249. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> While sellers set early support at $62.98, buyers stepped in to end the day with a marginally higher close establishing resistance at $65.09. The gentle move higher was enough to signal an uptrend on the charts as the EMAs did enough to cross to the upside. Oil has traded within this $2 daily range since late last week and is managing to keep clear of the $58.58 support level. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> The cryptocurrency traded within an uncharacteristically narrow range between $83K and $84.6. The trend is sideways as price action is contained in the mid $80K area. Note the price activity continues to hover around the descending trendline which has been in place since the start of the year. Buyers look up above $86K while sellers aim below $83K.
