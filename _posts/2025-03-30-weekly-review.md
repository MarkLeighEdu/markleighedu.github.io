### USD INDEX

Volatile price activity saw the USD rally early in the week, yet buyers were unable to hold on to the gains as sellers stepped in to close the week where it started, with a doji like candle confirming the uncertainty. Resistance sits at 104.33 with support at 103.44. While the downtrend remains intact, note the double bottom (strong reversal sign) higher high and higher low on the charts, plus the EMAs have crossed to the upside on the dailies.

### S&P 500

Sellers dominated the major equity markets with the S&P support at 5617 marking a yearly low close. Noteworthy that the traditional inverse relationship between the USD and equities has blurred as both indicies moved lower. Resistance was established at 5837. April 2 is the date that tariffs come into effect and the stock markets will nervously wait to reflect the immediate reaction. Monthly, weekly and daily charts all confirm the technical downtrend.

### GOLD

A strong $90 rally for the week saw buyers set new all-time highs for the metal as the year long uptrend continues with a series of higher highs and higher lows. Demand has been unwavering at all levels as the commodities safe haven status is confirmed - geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainty all contributing. Adding to the rally is golds inverse relationship with a weak USD. Resistance at $3090 with support at $3000 - a level which could prove to be a pivotal when profit taking or a natural retracement enter the picture.

### BRENT OIL

A 3rd consecutive week of higher highs and higher lows within the downtrend paints a somewhat conflicting technical picture. The resistance level at $73.50 is noteworthy as it is matches the 32.85 fib retracement area measured from the preceding downtrend and halted the buyers from adding to the demand. Sellers will aim to maintain below $73 as buyers look up to breaking resistance on the way to testing $74.

### BITCOIN

Price action was contained between $82K and $89K with neither side able to establish a meaningful trend. The trend is down with buyers unable to break and maintain above the high $80s while sellers struggle to break through the low $80K support area. Lack of fundamental news is adding to the narrow sideways activity.
