<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> A 2nd consecutive day of USD strength across the board - with the index and majors all confirming demand for the global reserve currency. Today's push higher shows a higher high and higher low on the chart. Technically buyers doing just enough to signal a crossover (EMAs) to the upside. Support sits at 96.45 with resistance at 97.42

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Another day, another record high as buyers continue to confirm demand for US equities across the board. The Feds dovish rate cut yesterday (25 bps) has been welcomed by the equity markets with sellers unable to sustain any intraday moves to the downside. Neither overbought technicals or profit taking have entered the equation, for now. Support at 6670 with resistance at 6718. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Yesterday's bearish engulfing candlestick pattern (reversal signal) played out today as sellers continued the strong push lower. Although gold has not lost its safe haven status, it appears the contributing factors are a combination of profit taking, overbought technical, as well as the traditional inverse relationship between strong USD and weak gold. Sellers now face a strong support area which buyers have guarded since September 11th 2025. Resistance at $3673 with support at $3627.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Sellers followed up from yesterday's sell-off and maintained control throughout the trading day. While sellers may have done enough to signal a downtrend by the slightest margin, price action continues to be contained with a relatively narrow range between $66 on the downside and $68 on the upside. Resistance at $67.98 with support at $66.68. Daily close at $67.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Slow and steady as buyers maintained control with a gentle push higher, reflected as A higher high and higher low on the daily chart. The demand is slight yet the uptrend remains intact and the bias continues to be tilted to the upside. Significantly, price action maintained above the $117K level late in the day. Support at $116.1K with resistance set at $117.9K.
