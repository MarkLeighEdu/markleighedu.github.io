<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The USD continued its push higher into the year end with the index adding a 3rd consecutive higher high and higher low on the chart. Note that the uptrend broke above the descending trendline which has been in effect since November 21st 2025. Resistance at 97.97 with support at 97.62.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> US major stock markets closed lower today with the S&P index closing slightly down on the day. Neither buyers or sellers made much of a move as activity slowed going into the last trading day of the year. Resistance at 6961 with support at 6938.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Buyers put in a brief rally earlier (Asian and European session) and then went on to give up the gains, ending the day back where it started. The doji-like candlestick confirms the lack of direction today. Notwithstanding yesterday's strong sell-off (year end settling/profit taking), the metal stands at $4346 as the year comes to an end. Bearing in mind the safe haven commodity started the year at $2860 - that's an impressive $1486 ($50%+) increase for the year! Resistance at $4405 with support at $4323.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Buyers won out on the day with the trend flattening out and day end prices matching that of yesterday's close. As yet, buyers have not been able to recoup last week's losses. The $61.00 level appears to be the comfort area as the year comes to a close. Resistance at $61.86 with support at $60.98

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Notwithstanding today's green candlestick, the tight sideways trend continued with yet another close hovering around the $88K level. Price activity remains contained within a narrow $3.5K range with buyers unable to break above $90K and sellers being held up at the $86.5 support. Resistance at $89.3K with support at $86.6K.
