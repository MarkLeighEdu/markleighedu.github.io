<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The USD strengthened for the 4th consecutive day extending the uptrend and establishing resistance at 104.14 with support sitting at 103.45. While sentiment towards the USD appears shaky, economic data remains positive as confirmed by the Fed last week. Noteworthy that the USDX and equity markets both moving higher to start the week. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> After gapping up to open the week, buyers added to the move higher and maintained control setting resistance at 5820. The positive tone across the major US equity markets stemmed from Trumps softening tone regarding tariffs and perhaps the markets anticipating a less drastic outcome as the April 2nd Liberation Day looms.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> A 3rd consecutive red day for the metal and a 3rd consecutive lower high on the daily charts. The retracement was certainly expected from a technical standpoint reflecting extremely overbought RSI readings. Also, a round of profit taking was to be expected. Add a strengthening USD to the equation and the selloff is not totally unexpected. Buyers will see the resilient $3000 support area as a positive for the safe haven commodity. $3033 resistance will be the first target on the upside while sellers will aim at $2980 on the downside.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Following the bounce up off $69.53 support last week, the uptrend has gained momentum as buyers added to recent gains and went onto establish resistance at $72.55. Higher highs and higher lows confirm the demand from both a technical and fundamental standpoint. With geopolitical conflicts appearing nowhere closer to being settled and supply concerns uncertain, Brent is seen moving further away from the pivotal $70 mark. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> A breakout day for the cryptocurrency as buyers added to a gap up over the weekend and went on to set resistance at $88.8K. As trading activity moved a leg higher from the previous $81K - $85K range, buyers will be eyeing above $90K for the first time since early March. Noteworthy that USDX, S&P and Bitcoin all moving in tandem. Technically the EMAs reflect the leading indicator pulling away sharply as well as the lower high on the daily chart being broken to the upside - all bullish signs for BTC.
