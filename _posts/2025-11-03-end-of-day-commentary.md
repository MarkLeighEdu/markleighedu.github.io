### USD INDEX

Nothing drastic, yet demand for USDs continues as buyers add to the uptrend with a 4th consecutive day of higher highs and higher lows on the chart. Next on the upside looks to be a test of the 100.00 mark. The world's reserve currency is the current asset of choice across financial markets. Resistance at 99.82 with support at 99.52.

### S&P 500

Following a gap higher to open, neither buyers or sellers could hold on to midday moves. Although sellers managed a very slight move lower to close, the candlestick looks close to a doji-like pattern which signals uncertainty and lack of direction. Lower highs add to the bearish feel. EMAs are flat. Resistance at 6909 with support at 6848.

### GOLD

Buyers squeaked out a win and green candlestick on the day, although practically the day closed pretty much where it started (and closed Friday) with neither side adding to intraday moves. Note the close at $4000 which continues to be a pivotal level. EMAs continue to point down as the downtrend remains intact. Resistance at $4027 with support at $3962.

### BRENT OIL

Although the daily candlestick is red, that's only because of the gap higher to open the day. Today marked the 3rd consecutive higher high and higher low on the chart adding to the daily uptrend. Resistance at $65.31 with support at $64.32. Lack of supply concerns, and geopolitical concerns apparently having little effect on the current price activity.

### BITCOIN

Sellers in total control as the day is set to close at the lowest level since July 2025. Price action is comfortably maintained below the descending trendline. Notwithstanding today's sharp move lower, the RSI at 39 signals further downside before oversold readings come into play. Note the Fibonacci retracement tool from the yearly low ($74.3K) up to the record high ($126.4K) - the reversal shows the current price hovering around the 38.2% fib retracement level at $106.5K. Buyers will look for a bounce up off this level, while sellers look to add to the sell-off. Resistance at $110.8K with support at $105.2K.
