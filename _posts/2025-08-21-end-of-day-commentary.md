### USD INDEX

Demand for USD started early and continued through all 3 trading sessions. Note that buyers have struggled to follow through above current resistance levels. Support at 98.03 with resistance at 98.55. While there is negative sentiment surrounding the dollar it appears there is no apparent heir to the global reserve currency. With rate cuts no longer a certainty, buyers remain in control.

### S&P 500

The index weakened for a 5th consecutive day with lower highs adding to the downtrend. Today's sell-off displayed the classic inverse relationship between strong USD and weak equities. Resistance at 6419 with support set at 6369, matching yesterday's low. Buyers did not step in as demand for equities has subsided since the record highs set late last week.

### GOLD

The metal sold off early, before buyers stepped in at the US session and recouped roughly half of the day's losses. The late rally was enough to keep the bias tilted upward as the safe haven commodity continues to trade comfortably within its current range. Support was set at $3325 with resistance higher at $3348. Gold's resilience stood strong in the face of USD strength.

### BRENT OIL

Demand for oil continued for the 3rd consecutive day with higher highs and higher lows adding to the uptrend. Buyers will aim to maintain price activity above the $67 mark. Support at $66.29 with resistance set at $67.26. Today's push up saw price action move a leg higher and back to the familiar and comfortable $66 - $67 range.

### BITCOIN

Sellers wiped out the gains from yesterday's brief rally and added to the well- established downtrend. Note the relevance of current support level at $112K - the Aug 2nd low, as well as resistance May 22nd. The bias has remained down since the strong bearish engulfing candlestick confirmed the reversal on Aug 14th. Resistance sits at $114.8K with support established at $111.9K.
