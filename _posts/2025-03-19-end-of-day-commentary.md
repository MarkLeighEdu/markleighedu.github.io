### USD INDEX

The index closed higher on a day of two halves. Pre Fed announcement the USD strengthened and set resistance at 103.54. Post the FOMC, the dollar sold off sharply erasing most of the earlier gains. The day closed with the bias down and negative sentiment surrounding the USD. Sellers will aim to break below 102.83 support while buyers look to maintain above 103 at a minimum.

### S&P 500

US major equity markets rallied post Fed announcement and saw the S&P establish resistance at 5769 before sellers stepped in to close at 5727. The uptrend remains in step with the inverse relationship between equities and the USD. As was the case yesterday, note that the resistance level matches the previous support from November 2024. The 2700 level is shaping up to be pivotal with buyers looking to maintain above the level while sellers look down at the 5658 support.

### GOLD

Another day, another record high. The metal set resistance at $3050 as demand continues at every new high. With both equity markets and the worlds reserve currency displaying choppy, volatile trading conditions, gold maintains its safe haven status in the face of both political and financial uncertainty. Dips and retracements on the shorter timeframes are seen as buying opportunities as profit taking has not yet entered the equation. It appears the $3000 level could be pivotal when sellers do enter the market.

### BRENT OIL

Neither buyers or sellers were able to add to intraday moves as we saw a daily close back where it started. The lack of direction was confirmed with a doji like candlestick on the daily charts. Price action remains contained within a $2 range between $69.50 and $70.50. The $70 mark remains the pivotal level as the sideways trend continues. Sellers may see the $72.25 mark as a lower high while buyers will aim to break above the resistance level.

### BITCOIN

Buyers took control of price action at $82.5K and never gave up the lead to finish strongly at the US close touching $85.9K. Significantly the month long descending trendline was broken as the uptrend gained momentum. Buyers will aim to test and break above $86K eyeing $90K further out.
