<h2>Connaissances</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">INDICE USD</strong> Buyers added slightly to yesterdays bounce up off support without much conviction. Unable to break above the lower high on the daily chart price action was contained between 103.12 support and 103.71 resistance. In response to a strong selloff in the major equity markets, todays move up looked more like a natural retracement rather than a demand for USD. Currencies reflect sentiment and the negative sentiment towards the worlds reserve currency remains in place.  

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P500</strong> Another volatile day in the equity markets with both tariffs and Ukraine in the spotlight. Traders exchanged blows with sellers winning the day and in so doing, set off alarm bells with rhetoric like panic and recession adding to the selloff. After a run up to setting resistance at 5675, sellers reversed the gains and went on to take out yesterdays support and set a new yearly low at 5559. These are levels last seen in September 2024.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">OR</strong> Unsurprisingly gold went on to set a new all time record high at $2988. An inverse relationship with the USD and a record of maintaining global safe haven status through geopolitical uncertainty, demand for the metal saw buyers break through resistance levels all through the day. With the $3000 mark clearly in view and fundamentals not about to change imminently, sellers are standing on the sidelines. Note however that profit taking could enter the picture before the weekend close.   

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">PÉTROLE DE BRENT</strong> After setting new resistance at $71.24 sellers stepped and recouped the majority of yesterdays gains before settling at $70.15. Sellers will aim below $70 and retest todays support $69.65 while buyers look up at $72. From a technical analysis point of view, note the contradiction with todays red candle adding a higher high and higher low on the daily chart.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">Bitcoin</strong> Following a 2 day bounce up off support, sellers confirmed the established downtrend setting support at $79.9K. Note the double top (strong reversal sign) on the daily charts at $84.2K. Sellers will aim to maintain below $80K and target the support at $76.4K.
