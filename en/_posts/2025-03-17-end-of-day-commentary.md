### USD INDEX

USD weakness continued to start the new week with sellers controlling activity and setting support at 103.03. With little demand for U$ and all the major FX pairs strengthening against the dollar, the yearly low at 102.83 appears to be the next downside target.

### S&P 500

A strong day for the US stock markets saw the S&P continue Fridays strong bounce up as buyers established resistance at 5761. Note the 5733 close price matches the support area from late 2024. Also noteworthy is the clear inverse relationship between USD and equity markets playing out, something we didn't see last week. Buyers will aim for 5800 while sellers look below 5700.

### GOLD

All the boxes are checked. The inverse relationship with the USD, demand for the safe haven commodity at all levels continues, $3000 attempted and broken. Sellers will watch for technical retracements with RSI signalling overbought, and profit taking at these record high levels; buyers will see pullbacks as new opportunities to join the bull run.

### BRENT OIL

While buyers began the day adding to the gap up to start the week, sellers stepped in at the $71.80 resistance to end the day back where the action started. A doji like candle confirms the indecision and uncertainty. The considerations for buyers are supply concerns and political uncertainty, while sellers look at a softening in latest US data releases and an overall economic slowdown. Note the relevance of the strong $71 support level.

### BITCOIN

Buyers won out in a relatively tight range between $82.4K and $84.7K. Stepping back we see that activity remains contained between $80K and $85K for the past 7 days. Notwithstanding the daily green candlestick and the EMAs signalling a downtrend, the descending trendline from $99.7K (Feb 21) shows a downward bias with lower highs and lower lows. Buyers will aim to break above $85K while sellers look below $80K.
